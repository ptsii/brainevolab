      	<p><strong>TRAVEL TO BLOOMINGTON</strong><br />
      	  <br />
      	  <strong>Please note: there is no airport in Bloomington, Indiana!</strong> If you are traveling to the conference by plane, make sure your flight is booked to the <strong>Indianapolis International Airport (IND)</strong>. &nbsp;Some people mistakenly book tickets to the airport in Bloomington, <em>Illinois</em> - but that is the wrong city!! It is 3 hours away (in a different State) from Indiana Unversity, Bloomington! &nbsp;Please be absolutely sure you are booking tickets to <strong>IND (Indianapolis International Airport).</strong><br />
      	  <br />
      	  You will need to arrange transportation to Bloomington from the airport in Indianapolis. There are two shuttle services that you may use: <a href="http://www.soashuttle.com/locations/bloomington-to-indianapolis/">Star of America</a> or <a href="https://goexpresstravel.com/airport_shuttle_schedule">GO Express Travel</a>. Booking ahead of time online saves a few dollars and guarantees you a seat at a particular time, but tickets are non-refundable in the event of flight delays.<br />
  <br />

There will be a fee for parking in these lots. Discount parking passes will be available at the registration check-in desk for conference participants. The approximate discounted parking fee is currently $12/day. </em></p>
