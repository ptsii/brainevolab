Instrumentalist approach</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><b><span style='font-family:
Calibri'>Chia-Hua LIN</span></b><span style='font-family:Calibri'>, <i>University
of South Carolina</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='font-family:Calibri'>There
is an ongoing interdisciplinary debate over the question of combining
linguistics and neuroscience for the purpose of understanding the biological
basis of the human faculty of language. On the one hand, a case that supports
such an interdisciplinary marriage can be made for the sake of practical
efficiency. On the other hand, it has been argued that the effort to locate the
linguistic units of study in the brain, such as ‘the syntax,’ is leading
towards hasty or even false conclusions. In this paper, coming from the
philosophy of science perspective, I argue that it is not the application of
linguistic units in neuroscientific investigations that leads to unwarranted
conclusions. The culprit is, rather, <i>the way</i> in which they are applied.
Using the example of Hauser et al.’s proposed research schema, which they base
on the developments in the minimalist program in linguistics, I discuss how a
linguistic model </span><span style='font-family:Calibri'>may be used as an
essential tool to advance neurolinguistics.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='font-family:Calibri'>The
faculty of language, or ‘FL’, is originally hypothesized to account for the
human ability of acquiring and using languages. Traditional research questions
regarding such a faculty concern the nature, the neural substrate, and the
evolution of the faculty. For instance, what makes up the FL? How does the
brain implement the FL? How has the FL evolved in the species? These three
questions are closely related. A proper understanding of what constitutes the
FL is necessary for a productive investigation of its neurophysiological
underpinnings. And a proper understanding of what underlies the FL is, in turn,
vital to a suitable evaluation of its phylogenetic history. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='font-family:Calibri'>However,
because of the joint breadth of these three topics, it may appear unrealistic
for an individual discipline, say, linguistics, biology, or neuroscience to
tackle all three of the inquiries independently. In fact, interdisciplinary
collaboration appears to be desirable in the name of efficiency. Linguists have
generated a body of literature on the nature of the FL, neuroscientists have
gained a wealth of knowledge on how the brain works in giving rise to other
cognitive faculties, and finally, biologists have accumulated a great deal of
insights on how a mechanism may have evolved. It would be reinventing the wheel
for, say, neuroscientists or biologists to start their research by defining
what language is. Arguments along these lines can be found in Hauser, Chomsky,
and Fitch (2002)<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=Footnoteanchor><span class=Footnoteanchor><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Calibri'>[1]</span></span></span></a> and Fitch (2010)<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=Footnoteanchor><span
class=Footnoteanchor><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Calibri'>[2]</span></span></span></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Their suggestion is to adapt core ideas of the minimalist program in
linguistics (such as generative grammar, discrete infinity, and recursion) to
the broader research areas of language including not only neuroscience and
evolutionary biology but also psychology and anthropology.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='font-family:Calibri'>Although
not directly challenging the use of the minimalist program, some prominent
linguists and neurolinguists’ work is in conflict with Hauser et al.’s view.
For example, Poeppel and Embick</span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=Footnoteanchor><span style='font-family:Calibri'><span
class=Footnoteanchor><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Calibri'>[3]</span></span></span></span></a><span
style='font-family:Calibri'> point out that the fundamental elements in
theories of linguistics, such as morphemes, syllables, and noun-phrases, are
defined for the purpose of analyzing and formalizing structures in specific
languages. In contrast, the fundamental elements in neurobiology, such as
dendrites, neurons, and cortical columns, are defined based on their anatomical
features. They argue that such linguistic and neurobiological elements are
incommensurable.&nbsp; Moreover, there has been no empirical evidence for a
direct mapping between linguistic and neurobiological elements, but only some
suggestive correlations. Hence, they conclude, “there is significant danger of
(long-term) interdisciplinary cross-sterilization rather than
cross-fertilization between linguistics and neurobiology, or, for that matter,
linguistics and other empirical disciplines.”</span><a href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=Footnoteanchor><span style='font-family:
Calibri'><span class=Footnoteanchor><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Calibri'>[4]</span></span></span></span></a><span style='font-family:Calibri'>
Moving forward, Poeppel and Embick call for “a substantive alternative research
program, by which neuroscientists can explore how brain mechanisms form the
basis for linguistic computation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='font-family:Calibri'>In
this paper, I extend Poeppel and Embick’s discussion on the comparability of
the elements across the disciplines to the minimalist program of Hauser et al.
I argue that the incomparability of elements across disciplines becomes a
problem when one attempts to create a directly map between the linguistic and
neurobiological elements. However, such a direct mapping reductionism is
required neither for the minimalist program nor for Hauser et al.’s proposed
research schema. More importantly, reductionism is not necessarily based on
such ‘maps.’ Therefore, what is hindering progress in neurolinguistics is not
the linguistic model per se but how it is used.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='font-family:Calibri'>To
demonstrate how the elements in linguistics may be essential to investigations
in empirical sciences, I first show that the Hauser et al.’s proposed research
schema provides a conceptual tool or a so-called ‘what-description’ which
specifies <i>what</i> is constitutively necessary—in terms of functional
elements and structures among these elements—for a linguistic capacity to be
realized. The alternative called for by Poeppel and Embick, in contrast, would
be a ‘how-description’ which specifies <i>how</i> the linguistic capacity in
question is implemented—in terms of neurobiological elements. Under this
distinction, I argue that Hauser et al.’s schema and the alternative suggested
by Poeppel and Embick are compatible. Then, I point out that due to the variety
of neuroimaging techniques, current research is producing many interesting, but
not necessarily showing a clearly converging picture. Thus, I argue, a
conceptual tool such as Hauser et al.’s proposed research schema is essential
to neuroscientific investigation, as it provides a framework that helps one to
see convergence where it may not have been visible before. Indeed, to evaluate
and compare discoveries from multiple disciplines, a what-description, such as
Hauser et al.’s schema, is indispensable because it provides a common reference
to compare variety of how-descriptions side-by-side. Thus, I will conclude that
what is needed may not be a neurolinguistic alternative to the linguistic
models but an alternative, non-reductionist way of using them. </span></p>
