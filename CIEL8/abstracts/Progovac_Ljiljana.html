margin-left:0in;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Calibri'>In order to hypothesize about the evolutionary origins of grammar, it
is essential to rely on a theory or model of human grammars. Interestingly,
scholars engaged in theoretical study of syntax, particularly those working
within the influential framework associated with linguist N. Chomsky, have been
reluctant to consider a gradualist, selection-based approach to
grammar/language (e.g. R. Berwick and N. Chomsky, 2016, <i>Why Only Us</i>, MIT
Press; see L. Progovac for a review of this book, to appear in <i>Language</i>).
Nonetheless, this theoretical framework has in fact been used to reconstruct
the stages of the earliest grammars, and to even identify the constructions in
present-day languages which resemble/approximate these early proto-grammars (L.
Progovac, 2015, <i>Evolutionary Syntax</i>, Oxford University Press). These
constructions can be considered “living fossils” of early grammars, in the
sense of R. Jackendoff (2002, <i>Foundations of Language</i>, Oxford University
Press). This reconstruction is at the right level of granularity to be able to
exclude some hypotheses regarding the hominin timeline, and to support others,
as well as to engage the fields of neuroscience and genetics. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>According to the <i>Minimalist Program</i>
(N. Chomsky, 1995, MIT Press), as well as the predecessors to this framework, modern
sentences are analyzed as hierarchical constructs, consisting of several layers
of structure, as illustrated in (1):<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> </span></span></p>

<p class=ColorfulList-Accent11 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>[TP &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [vP
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [SC/VP]]]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Here TP is a Tense Phrase layer
(sentence), vP is a transitive (higher) verb Phrase, VP is the basic Verb
Phrase, and SC is a Small Clause. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Thus,
to derive a sentence such as <i>Deer will eat fish</i>, one first assembles the
inner layer, SC/VP (<i>eat fish</i>). The transitivity layer (<i>deer</i>) and
the tense layer (<i>will</i>) are added only later on top of this SC
foundation. In other words, while VP/SC can be constructed without any higher
layers, vP or TP can only be constructed upon the foundation of VP/SC. Importantly,
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>this type of hierarchy offers the
following precise and straightforward method of reconstructing previous
syntactic stages in evolution:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Structure
X is considered to be evolutionarily primary relative to Structure Y if X can
be composed independently of Y, but Y can only be built upon the foundation of
X.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The layer upon which the whole sentence
rests is the inner, foundational (<i>eat fish</i>) layer (VP/SC), which I
therefore reconstruct as the initial stage of grammar: a flat, tenseless, intransitive
two-slot mold, in which transitivity, and with it the subject/object
distinction, cannot be expressed grammatically. The unspecified role of the
noun in this layer can be characterized as the absolutive role, as such roles
are not directly sensitive to the subject/object distinction. Absolutive-like
roles are found not only in languages classified as ergative-absolutive, but
probably in all languages, in some guise or another. Human languages in fact
differ profoundly in how they express transitivity, and this reconstructed
absolutive-like basis, as will be shown, provides the common denominator, the
foundation from which all the variation can arise. Given this approach,
variation in the expression of transitivity can shed light on the hominin
timeline, as well as the timing of the emergence of hierarchical stages of
grammar. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>To take just one example, absolutive-like
fossils are found among verb-noun compounds, as in English: <i>cry-baby</i>, <i>kill-joy</i>,
<i>tattle-tale</i>, <i>turn-coat</i>, <i>scatter-brain</i>, <i>tumble-dung</i>
(insect); Serbian <i>cepi-dlaka</i> (split-hair; hair-splitter), <i>ispi-_utura</i>
(drink-up flask; drunkard), <i>vrti-guz</i> (spin-butt; fidget), <i>jebi-vetar</i>
(screw-wind; charlatan); and Twi (spoken in Ghana) <i>kukru-bin</i>
(roll-feces; beetle). Comparing compounds such as <i>turn-table</i> and <i>turn-coat</i>,
we observe that the first describes a table that turns (table is subject-like),
and the second describes somebody who turns his/her coat, metaphorically
speaking (coat is object-like). But these two compounds are assembled by
exactly the same grammar: the two-slot verb-noun mold, not marking any subject/object
distinctions.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:Calibri'>[1]</span></span></span></a>
In addition to illustrating this basic grammar, such verb-noun compounds in various
languages specialize for derogatory reference and insult, with many crude,
obscene representatives, suggesting a possible role of sexual selection in the
emergence of early grammars (L. Progovac and J. L. Locke, 2009, “The urge to
merge,” <i>Biolinguistics</i>). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Interestingly, in their article “On the
antiquity of language,” D. Dediu and S. Levinson (2013, <i>Frontiers in
Psychology</i>) express their hope that some combinations of structural
features will prove so conservative that they will allow deep reconstruction,
which would shed light on the possible language abilities of e.g. Neanderthals.
I propose that the earliest stages of syntax/grammar as reconstructed here
provide just such a conservative platform, which could have been commanded also
by our cousins and the common ancestor. I will also provide a sample of such flat
proto-grammar, together with the concrete vocabulary that can be deduced from
fossil structures.</span></p>

<p class=Abstract style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
margin-left:0in;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
Calibri'>Here I also briefly report on some specific findings of the fMRI
experiment in which we tested the predictions of this proposal (Progovac,
Crabtree, Rakhlin, Angell, Liddane, Tang, and Ofen, “Neural correlates of
syntax and proto-syntax,” in submission). In contrast to their modern
hierarchical counterparts, the flat (fossil) structures were hypothesized to
show less focused activation in the networks specialized for syntax, in
particular Broca’s-basal ganglia network, but more activation in the areas not
narrowly specialized for abstract syntactic processing, expecting that such
proto-syntactic structures can still recruit more general and more diffuse,
ancestral patterns of brain activation. Importantly, comparable processing
patterns have also been reported for KE family members with a FOXP2 gene
mutation, implicated in SLI (specific language impairment) (F. Liégeois et al.,
2003, “Language fMRI abnormalities associated with FOXP2 gene mutation,” <i>Nature
Neuroscience</i>). This approach thus reveals some intriguing new possibilities
for testing and cross-fertilizing the specific hypotheses on the evolution of
grammar/language with the findings in genetics, language disorders, and
neuroscience. </span></p>

two-slot grammar seems to be within reach to non-humans, revealing where
continuity should be sought. To take one example, the bonobo Kanzi has reportedly
mastered such grammar in his use of lexigrams and gestures (P. Greenfield and
S. Savage-Rumbaugh, 1990, “Language and intelligence in monkeys and apes”).<span
