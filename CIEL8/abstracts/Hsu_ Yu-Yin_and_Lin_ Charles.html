<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Language is a complex adaptive
system with multiple factors interacting with one another for linguistic
comprehension and production. When one says 'Every man loves a woman', does it
mean every man loves a <i>different</i> woman (i.e., the surface universal quantified
reading), or the same woman (i.e, the inverse existential quantified reading)? Doubly
quantified sentences in English can express either the surface or the inverse
scope thus denoting both universal and existential readings (e.g., May, 1985).
One may wonder what factors contribute to scopal preferences in reading similar
sentences in Chinese, a language that is typologically different from English. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Three approaches have been
taken to understand English sentences like these. Kurtzman and MacDonal (1993)
report in an acceptability task that active sentences prefer the surface scope.
In an ERP study, Dwivedi et al. (2010) report that sentences are ambiguous
initially, and the structural computation occurs later. However, both studies
showed that stimuli did not behave uniformly, suggesting that certain
verb-lexical biases exist. Although the scope preference was not the focus of their
picture-priming study, Raffray and Pickering (2010) report that the surface
reading was preferred.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Unlike English, it has been
argued in the literature of generative syntax that Chinese only allows the
surface scope (e.g., Huang, 1982; Aoun and Li, 1993). Nonetheless, it is
reported that &quot;sometimes&quot; the inverse scope is available (e.g., <i>Mei
ge xuesheng dou pa yi wei nan laoshi </i>'Every student is afraid of a male
teacher). Concerning Chinese sentence processing, some report that no inverse
scope is available (Scontras et al., 2013; Tsai et al. 2014); some others
report that the inverse scope is available, but there is no consensus on what
kind of condition licenses what type of scope (Zhou and Gao, 2009; Hsu and Lin,
2014). Thus, we attempt to study whether the inverse scope is available in
Chinese doubly quantified sentences and what lexical effects contribute to which
scope preference.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>This paper report results from two
online reading experiments. Assuming that verbs within each verb type are the
same, we looked at the effects of different aspectuality and of verb types (action,
locative, perception, psych verbs), separately.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Experiment 1 examined different
types of aspecuality paired with the same action verb ‘attack’: perfective <i>le</i>,
durative<i> zhe</i>, experienced <i>guo</i>, progressive <i>zai</i>, and the
zero form. It is generally assumed that <i>le</i> indicates the end result of
an event, and <i>guo</i> indicates an event has been experienced and no longer
exists at the speech time. As denoting the imperfective type of aspect, <i>zai</i>
indicates an action in progress, and <i>zhe</i> indicates a static durative
state (Smith 1991). The mean reading time shows that the inverse reading is
preferred when it is marked with imperfect durative <i>zhe</i>, and no
preference is shown with the zero form, unlike aspect <i>le</i>, <i>guo</i>,
and <i>zai</i>, which prefer the surface reading. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Experiment 2 used a new
linguistic context to examine two different surface word orders of doubly
quantified sentences. Previous studies usually used the ‘<i>Every … a</i> …’
order. In Chinese such quantifier order in a declarative sentence requires a marker
<i>dou</i> ‘all’, which expresses a semantic function that is still
controversial (e.g., as a distributive operator in Lee 1986, or as a maximality
operator in Xiang 2008). In light of the fact that the inverse scope of <i>Every
&gt; a</i> sentences entails the surface scope (Reinhart 1978), but that in
sentences like <i>A kid climbed every tree</i>, the reading of multiple kids
climbing trees is only possible when the inverse reading is available, we
examined two quantifier orders (<i>Every … a</i> …. vs. <i>A… every….</i>) in conditional
SVO sentences marked by <i>yaoshi</i> ‘if’, i.e., an environment that can
naturally accommodate both existential quantified subject without the
definite-marker <i>you</i> ‘exist’, and <i>every</i>-quantified subject without
<i>dou</i> ‘all’. The results suggest that, for perception verbs such as <i>hear</i>
and <i>watch</i>, in the order <i>Every … a</i> …, the preferred interpretation
is the existential reading, and in the order <i>A… every…</i>, the preferred
interpretation is the universal reading. This suggests that the inverse reading
can be available in Chinese. For action and psych verbs, no obvious preference
was found, a result more in line with the report in Dwivedi et al. (2010) for
English, that is, quantifier sentences may remain ambiguous during processing.</p>
