<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>For over a hundred years, almost all scientific
studies of language (i.e., in linguistics, speech and hearing science,
experimental psychology of language, etc.) have assumed that every language is
defined by a fixed set of <i>phonemes</i>, the discrete sound types used for
spelling words in memory, plus a set of <i>words</i> (or morphemes), short
chunks of speech with fairly distinct meanings, that are composed into <i>sentences</i>,
which are themselves word sequences that supposedly represent a ``complete
thought’’ (and contain both a subject and a predicate). &nbsp;Chomsky took
these traditional ideas about discrete symbol types nested within each other (<i>Phonemes</i>
within <i>Words</i> within <i>Phrases</i> within <i>Sentences</i>), into patterns
that closely resemble the conventional structure of the written form of most
languages, and invented a formal mathematics of symbol strings called <i>generative
grammar</i>.&nbsp; His contributions to formalizing this idea made him famous
since these ideas were directly applicable to the development of programming
languages for computers. &nbsp;&nbsp;But all formal grammars (from binary machine
code to Matlab and Word) are human artifacts (just like arithmetic, calculus
and chess) and rely on idealizations like perfectly discrete symbols that are
manipulated outside of real time by a discrete-time clock.&nbsp; &nbsp;But
human speech lives in continuous time and consists of conventional motor and
acoustic patterns that only in very rough terms resemble formal symbols.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Without idealized symbols (all of which are apparently modelled historically on
orthographic letters), formal grammars cannot be constructed.&nbsp; In fact, none
of the basic unit types for spoken language (e.g., <i>phonemes</i> and <i>words</i>)
have ever been given definitions that are empirically satisfactory.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It has never been possible to specify exactly what the set of psychological phonemes
is for any language (and thus what the phonological spelling is for any word)
or what the list of words is (unless one takes the traditional conventions of
orthography as decisive), nor why it is that most spontaneous speech fails to
satisfy the constraints of sentence definitions offered by school teachers or
linguists.&nbsp; &nbsp;The implication of all this for those who seek to
understand early stages of the evolution of language is that much of what
linguists have offered to address language evolution, in particular, the notion
that human languages are, in fact, instances of <i>formal systems</i> of any
kind cannot possibly be true.&nbsp; Of course, the use of formal systems to
merely model human language is reasonable and may offer insights.&nbsp; However,
human language cannot actually BE a formal system so the problem of when and
how humans began to have formal systems built in to their brains simply does
not arise.&nbsp; Formal systems, from chess to integer arithmetic to logic to
computer programs to generative grammars are always, without exception, deliberate
human artifacts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, ideas such as postulating an abrupt genetic
change that creates neural mechanisms capable of processing formal symbol
strings (e.g., Chomsky, Bickerton, etc.) can be safely ignored.&nbsp; But how
could the idea that a language is a formal system be so persuasive that the
basics of this idea have remained powerful for over a century despite many
obvious forms of evidence that the assumption is false?&nbsp; I believe it is
because the (edited) written orthography (of English, at least) very roughly
approximates the product of a formal system, e.g., it uses a discrete alphabet
of fixed size, a relatively fixed inventory of conventional words and word
sequences divided into units separated by a [period+space+capital letter]. &nbsp;&nbsp;Those
of us with education began pir training for our language in terms of formal
tokens like letters, words and sentences when we were extremely young.&nbsp;
Breaking free of that terminology is extremely difficult despite the failure of
formal models to account for human speech.</span></p>
