lang=EN-GB>Cochlear implants work and they work well in restoring hearing to a
large number of profoundly deaf children and adults. For prelingually deaf
infants and very young children, cochlear implantation is now the standard of
care in the medical field for the treatment of profound deafness. Despite the
efficacy of cochlear implantation, there still remain a number of significant
unresolved issues related to the effectiveness of cochlear implants in infants,
children and adults. In addition to the clinical issues related to the medical
treatment of deafness, there are also a number of broader theoretical issues
related to language acquisition, neural plasticity and brain development in
prelingually deaf children. The enormous individual differences routinely observed
in speech and language outcomes following implantation is an important
unresolved problem that has not been satisfactorily resolved. In this
presentation, I discuss several broad issues related to the effects of early
auditory deprivation on speech and language development within the context of
recent work on cochlear implants. In many respects, current research on
cochlear implants can be thought of as the modern equivalent of the
&quot;forbidden experiment&quot; in the field of language development (where
some children are deprived of access to language) but with an intervention that
partially restores hearing to a damaged sensory system supporting the
development of language and cognitive skills.</span></p>
