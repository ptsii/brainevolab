<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Calibri'>Recent years have seen increasing
interest in the research of co-evolution of the stone tools making and language.
In a study of Paleolithic technology and human evolution, Ambrose (2001) put forward
a hypothesis that complex tool-making, which required fine motor skills,
problem-solving and task planning might have influenced the evolution of the
frontal lobe, and co-evolved with the grammatical language 300,000 years ago. By
conducting a series of experiments in teaching contemporary humans the art of
Oldowan stone-knapping, Morgan and his colleagues (2015) arrived at their
conclusion that the stone tool-making might generate some selection for
teaching and language. A series of brain imaging studies conducted by Stout et
al. (2011) have shown that&nbsp;tools making and language use similar parts of
the brain, including regions involved in manual manipulations and speech
production. Uomini and Meyer (2013) applied a technique called functional
transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (fTCD) to subjects in the field to monitor
their brains during the vigorous activity of making stone tools, the results
offered support for the hypothesis that language and tools making
coevolved.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Calibri'>If it is possible that the stone
tools making and human language could have co-evolved in the Paleolithic Ages, then
what could have triggered the neurological and cognitive mechanisms for
language when our ancestors were undertaking to make their stone tools? What
are the common cognitive grounds underlying the production of the stone tools
and language (to be more specific, what are the common cognitive grounds in the
production of different modes of stone tools and different word classes)? Is it
possible for the present-day brain imaging equipments to pick up these
cognitive patterns? These questions might offer some help in better understanding
the co-evolution of stone tools making and human language in their earliest
stages. This paper reports a series of fMRI studies on the neurological and
cognitive relationships between the making of different mode of stone tools (Clark,
1969) and the different semantic pattern of word categories (Guo, 2013), in order
to provide empirical evidence for the co-evolution of the stone tools making
and lexical development in the Paleolithic Ages. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Calibri'>A group of college students are
asked to have their brains scanned when they are thinking about stone tools
making and the semantic meaning of some word classes. <span style='color:black'>The
paper is focused on this question: What are the common cognitive grounds
underlying the production of different modes of stone tools and different semantic
patterns of word classes? This general question is divided into 4 specific
questions: (1) What cognitive properties are required in the production of each
mode of the stone tools? (2) What cognitive properties are required in the
production of each of different word classes? (3) What are the cognitive
patterns in the evolutionary development of the stone tools making and
different word classes? (4) Can the cognitive properties and patterns be mapped
between the stone tools making and lexical</span><span style='color:#3366FF'> </span><span
style='color:black'>development? </span>The following analytical techniques are
employed in the data analyses: analytical induction, cognitive analysis,
contrastive analysis, logical analysis, phenomenology, and semantic analysis. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Calibri'>According to cognitive
linguistics, human’s language competence is not a specialized innate faculty of
the brain, but rather a by-product of a general cognitive development in the
hominin evolution. The tempo and mode of the stone tools making can help to
interpret the associated cognitive and communicative (i.e. language)
development of those tools makers. We argue that cognitive development for
language occurs concurrently and is interrelated with the intellectual
development for stone tools making. The chief reason why language could have
co-evolved with the stone tools making lies in that they require the same or
similar functioning in the cerebral and cognitive development. When our
ancestors were undertaking to make their stone tools, the intellectual demand
for problem-solving, the drive for communications, the coordination between the
hand and mind, the need for voicing instead of gesturing in teaching, all this
would have triggered the cognitive mechanisms for language. </span></p>
