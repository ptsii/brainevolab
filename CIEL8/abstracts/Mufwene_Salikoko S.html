<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:8.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Phylogenetically, languages appear to have evolved incrementally
from nothing to modern complex systems over a long period of time. Thus one may
expected the role of pragmatics to have decreased, conversely, as claimed by
some students of language evolution (e.g., Ljiljana Progovac 2015, <i>Evolutionary
syntax</i><u>;</u> and Tom Scott-Phillips 2014, <i>Speaking our minds</i>). The
logic behind this expectation is that languages as technologies capable of
communicating rich loads of information explicitly and systematically have
evolved from poor, primitive tools that depend heavily on context to
increasingly richer, more nuanced, and complex systems that depend less on
context for the interpretation of utterances. In other words, modern languages
would make us less reliant on our natural mind-reading capacity, contrary to
embryonic languages of, say, 200.000 years ago. However, reality shows that
pragmatics itself has actually evolved to play a more complex role now than it
ever did at the time when embryonic forms of modern languages emerged. According
to some, such as Deidre Wilson &amp; Dan Sperber (1992ff), we still rely heavily
on the mind-reading capacity to interpret utterances in modern languages. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:8.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>An important reason for this increased reliance on
pragmatics is that there was less information to convey at the protolinguistic
stage, in part because the hominine mental capacity was not yet as generative
as it is today and human interactions were simpler. If the earliest stages of
the evolution of spoken languages from animal-like vocalizations involved just
naming, which drove the expansion of phonetic systems, communication may have
started with child-like holophrases (Mufwene 2013). These do not require nuancing
and finessing the expression of the meanings intended by the speaker. Few
systematic pragmatic principles are involved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:8.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>In the earliest, primitive stages of the phylogenetic
emergence of languages, there would have been no pressure to sometimes speak
indirectly; nor may it have been necessary to choose between polite and
impolite expressions, or between deferential, humbling, and neutral forms of address,
as in languages such as Japanese and Korean. On the other hand, it is also
useful to encode in modern languages special perspectives relative to the
addressee in saying either <i>I was coming to see you</i> or <i>I was going to
see you</i> (as made evident by Fillmore 1975). In addition, the context of
communication bears on the interpretation of such seemingly simple
constructions as <i>I’m about to come</i> in ways that do not apply to its
counterpart <i>I’m about to go</i>. Interlocutors must also deal with
implicatures, where alternative expressions may appear related but do not
express exactly the same meanings. For instance, <i>Jane is wearing a <u>pink</u>
dress</i> does not have the same meaning as <i>Jane is wearing a <u>pale red</u>
dress</i>, no more than <i>Peter <u>killed</u> his pet</i> in relation to <i>Peter
<u>caused</u> his pet <u>to die</u></i>, although the longer expressions can be
used to explain their shorter alternatives (McCawley 1979).<i> </i>Adult linguistic
competence is assessed based on how one distinguishes between such expressions.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:8.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>It appears that the more complex the encoding of
meanings into expressions has become, the more complex the pragmatics of
language use has evolved. Why is the verb <i>sleep</i> interpreted only one way
in <i>the baby slept with his mother</i> but not in <i>John slept with Mary</i>
when both arguments refer to adults? Even <i>John slept with his mother</i> may
arouse a shock in some contexts but not in others!<i> </i>Why doesn’t the
phrase <i>sleep around</i> lend itself to such ambiguities but not <i>stand
around</i> or <i>sit around</i>? And why is it not appropriate in some cultures
not to speak literally past a certain age? What’s so special with non-literal
or indirect speech? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>I will discuss these issues and others, which
underscore the relevance of pragmatics in modern languages, from an
evolutionary perspective.</span></p>
