style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Calibri'>Objective</span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Calibri'>: The frontal N400 (FN400) and
parietal late positive complex (LPC) are two event-related potential (ERP)
components commonly elicited in an old/new judgment task, in which subjects are
asked to determine whether a given item belongs to a studied list (old) or not
(new). Consistent with a dual-processing notion of memory in which the neural
substrates supporting familiarity and recollection are distinct, these two
temporally separated ERP components have frequently been accepted as indices of
familiarity and the confidence in the recollection of studied items,
respectively.&nbsp; However, another prominent proposal postulates that
familiarity and recollection are both reflected in the LPC component, with a
reduction in the FN400 magnitude indexing conceptual priming instead. The
present study aims to examine the functional role of FN400 by including both
pictures and visual words in the studied list.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Calibri'>Rationale and hypothesis</span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Calibri'>:&nbsp; Previous works have
reported that FN400 effect is present only if the studied items are presented
in the same visual form during the subsequent old/new judgment, e.g., both as
pictures or visual words.&nbsp; This result contradicts the conceptual priming
hypothesis for FN400, which would predict that an FN400 effect could still be
observed even if pictures and visual words were to be used, respectively, in
the studied list and during the old/new judgment. One potential reason why such
picture-to-word conceptual priming has not been observed is that previous
studies have not included a subsequent recollection task to measure the
confidence of the old/new judgment, a factor that is known to influence both the
FN400 and LPC amplitudes. In this ongoing work, we therefore re-examine the
generality of the conceptual priming hypothesis by determining whether a
picture-to-word priming effect can be found, when the trials in which subjects
fail to recollect episodic details of the studied items are excluded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Calibri'>Method</span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Calibri'>: A group of 20+ university
students will be asked to name a list of 80 items, which alternate between
pictures and disyllabic Chinese words presented visually in groups of 20 items.
Given that increasing the number of times the studied list is presented is
known to enhance both FN400 and LPC, the whole list will be presented twice to
increase the “memory strength” of the studied items.&nbsp; Subjects will then
be asked to perform an old/new judgment for a word list that comprises 120 words
of three memory categories: (1) old picture words (corresponding to studied pictures);
(2) old repeated words (identical to the visual words in the studied list); and
(3) new words. The three sets of words are matched in semantic category,
familiarity, and number of strokes (separately for the first and second Chinese
characters). For each word that is judged “old”, subjects will be further asked
to recollect whether it has first been presented to them as picture or visual
word. This recollection task provides the basis for isolating the trials in
which the old/new judgment is made with high confidence for ERP analysis. The
peak amplitudes and latencies of FN400 and LPC components will be measured at
the frontal and parietal electrodes, respectively, and analyzed by planned
pairwise comparisons among the three memory categories. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Calibri'>Expected findings</span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Calibri'>: Both the old picture words and
old repeated words are expected to elicit a less negative FN400 and more positive
LPC than new words. &nbsp;The presence of picture-to-word priming will support
the conceptual priming hypothesis of the FN400. Whether a difference in FN400
magnitude can be observed between the two types of old words depends on a
number of factors (e.g., the strength of form priming, and the differential
efficiency of memory encoding for pictures and words). Thus, such comparison will
be done for the sole purpose of evaluating the relative efficacy of pictures and
words in eliciting the old/new effects.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Calibri'>Research significance</span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Calibri'>: This work will shed light on the
conceptual priming hypothesis of the FN400, which helps resolve the two
prominent proposals regarding the association of FN400 to either conceptual
priming or familiarity.&nbsp; Also, the present work is an initial experiment
for establishing that the FN400 and LPC effects can be consistently elicited in
the present paradigm, which is intended to be subsequently used for evaluating
decline in episodic memory in normal aging and pathological aging. The paradigm
will find potential use in the diagnosis of various neurological diseases,
particularly those in which episodic memory deficit is one of the first
behavioral symptoms (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease).</span></p>
