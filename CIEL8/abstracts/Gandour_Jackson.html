style='font-size:12.0pt'>Voice pitch is an important information-bearing
component of language that is subject to experience-dependent plasticity at
both early cortical and subcortical stages of processing. Pitch processing
itself is influenced by linguistically-relevant functional properties of the
language that an individual is exposed to. Tonal languages provide a unique window
for tracing the hierarchical transformation of pitch along the auditory pathway
and beyond in the human brain, and as a consequence, affords us an opportunity
to study lexical tone, neuroplasticity and language evolution. Human brain
responses at both cortical and subcortical levels are differentially weighted
depending on specific temporal attributes of pitch. Functional neuroimaging
(fMRI) shows that pitch processing recruits the hemispheres differentially as a
function of its phonological relevance to the listener. The mismatch negativity
(MMN)—a neural index of early, cortical processing—shows that pitch processing is
shaped by the relative saliency of tonal features. The frequency following
response (FFR)—a neural index of pitch encoding at the level of the auditory brainstem—shows
that enhancement of pitch features is sensitive to rapidly-changing sections of
tonal contours<span style='color:black'>. The cortical pitch-specific response
(CPR)—a series of neural markers sensitive to temporal attributes of dynamic
pitch contours (Na, Pb, Nb; Na–Pb, Pb–Nb)—reveals language-dependent
sensitivity to separate attributes of pitch during early stages of sensory
processing in the auditory cortex. </span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>These
restrictions to separate pitch attributes suggest that relative weighting of
CPR components varies depending on their sensitivity within a particular temporal
window. Manipulation of pitch salience and pitch height yields heightened
sensitivity in the earlier temporal window (Na-Pb). In contrast, changing rate
of pitch acceleration relative to a constant rate evokes heightened sensitivity
in the later temporal window (Pb–Nb). Differences in relative changes in
magnitude between cortical and brainstem components may implicate
transformation in pitch processing at the cortical level, presumably mediated
by local sensory and/or extrasensory influence overlaid on the brainstem
output. A theoretical framework for a neural network is proposed. It involves
coordination between local, feedforward, and feedback components that can
account for experience-dependent enhancement of pitch representations at
multiple locations of an integrated, distributed pitch processing network. In
regard to the theme of this conference, these empirical data on
experience-dependent </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>neuroplasticity
of pitch processing may add another perspective to include in the story of the
evolution of language.</span></p>
