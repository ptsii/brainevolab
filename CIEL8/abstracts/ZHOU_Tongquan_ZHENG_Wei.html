<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>In the surface structure,
English object-extracted relative clauses (ORCs, hence forth) are much similar
to their corresponding appositive clauses (ACs, henceforth) (e.g., ORC: <u>The fact
that the manager had mentioned</u> was important. vs. AC: <u>The fact that the manager
had mentioned the password </u>was important.). But in terms of Chomskyan
generative linguistics, ORCs are different from ACs in that there is a
movement-resulting gap after the clause verb (e.g., <i>had mentioned</i>) in
ORCs while there isn’t in ACs. May this difference lead to different processing
patterns in our English sentence comprehension? Are there other factors
contributing to their different processing patterns? In order to answer these
questions, we used self-paced reading technique to investigate how the two
types of clauses were processed on-line in Chinese EFL learners. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Our experiment, which was
carried out in 40 English majors with high proficiency in a China’s key
university, was composed of two tasks, as sampled in (1) and (2) below. The
first task was designed to compare the reading comprehension of ORCs and ACs.
We inserted an extra two-word adverbial phrase, i.e., R5 in (1a) after the clause
verb in ORCs so that the two ypes of clauses were well matched in both length
and structure. In actual experiment, all the sentences based on their functions
were divided into seven regions for visual display, one region for each time.
The second task (True or False word judgment) as a complement to the first was
to compare the processing of R5 (PP in ORC and NP in AC) in isolation in order
to investigate whether their difference or similarity may affect the processing
of whole clauses in which they were positioned respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Our results (based on
two-tailed T-tests) demonstrate that (1) in clause-related sentence
comprehension accuracy, ACs tend to be more difficult to process than ORCs but
the difficulty doesn’t reach significance (ORCs: 81.39% vs. ACs: 76.39%, p=.09&gt;.05);
with regard to reaction time, more time are spent in RCs than in ORCs as a
whole(ORCs: 6842.94ms vs. ACs: 7454.17ms, t=-4.345,df=30, p=0.000), further
confirming what the comprehension data indicate. In the critical regions (R5,
R6, and R7), the PP in ORCs requires significantly less time to be processed
than the NP in ACs (PP in ORCs: 1194.05ms vs. NP in ACs: 1317.90ms,
p=.017&lt;.05); this difference is further magnified as the participants move
to read the linking verb “be” at R6 ( ORCs: 634.44ms vs. ACs: 749.02ms,
p=.003&lt;.05) and continues to exist at the final word (R7)( ORC: 1030.97ms
vs. ACs: 1155.68ms, p=.010&lt;.05); and (2) more time are spent in the PP than
the NP when they are comprehended in isolation (PP: 1387.46ms vs. NP:
1225.55ms, p=.025&lt;.05) but when put in the sentence context as in (1), the
PP’s reading time is significantly reduced (in isolation: 1387.46ms vs. in
sentence: 1181.99ms, p=.033&lt;.05) while the NP’s reading time is increased in
contrast, though not significantly different (in isolation: 1225.55ms vs. in
sentence: 1288.87ms, p=.489&gt;.05). In summary, ACs are more difficult to
process than ORCs and the difficulty difference appears initially at the PP/NP
(R5) and reaches its peak at the matrix clause verb (“be” in this experiment)
and basically keeps until the adjective , the end of the sentence.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>A number of factors are
supposed to account for the above data. To begin with, the syntactic gap
assumed by Chomsky and his followers contribute to ACs’ greater difficulty
relative to ORCs in processing. As the participants move their eyes to R4 (the
clause verb position), they know &nbsp;they are reading an ORC where there is an
object gap left by the moved sentence-initial NP. When they continue to read
the following adverbial in ORCs, they confirm their prior judgment. In
contrast, when the participants move to read the NP following the clause verb
in ACs, they find their prior judgment is a mistake for the object gap is
already filled by another NP (the real object of AC) , which requires a
reanalysis of the sentence-initial NP’s syntactic status consequently. That is,
while ORCs leave the object gap unfilled that the participants can easily
recognize the initial NP as its corresponding antecedent, ACs have the gap
filled and thus require the participants to reassess the initial NP’s status,
giving rise to more time spent and more cognitive resources demanded as a
result. Next, more working memory resources are required in processing ACs than
ORCs. At R5, the sentence-initial NP has been confirmed to act as the object of
the clause verb (R4) in ORCs and such confirmation helps establish the SV
relation between the initial NP and the matrix clause verb “be” (R6). By
comparison, the processing of ACs is confronted with the competition of two NPs,
the initial NP and the post-verb NP, not only at R5 (where they compete for the
objecthood of the subordinate clause) but also at R6 (where they compete for
the subject- hood of the matrix clause verb). Two competitions mean two
analyses, leading to more cognitive resources consumed in ACs. That’s why the
processing difference between ORCs and ACs reaches its peak at the main clause
verb. In addition, ORCs’ relative ease is attributed to the lexical meaning of
the adjective at the end of the sentence. In order to make the whole sentence
welll-formed, the final adjective must be in semantic harmony with a preceding
NP to build up an effective subject-complement relationship. In ORCs, the
adjective is easy to match the only one NP (the initial NP) to serve as the
subject candidate while hard to make one choice from the two competing NPs (the
initial NP and the post-verbt NP) in ACs, resulting in more processing demands accordingly.
Finally, linguistic context helps modulate the processing difficulty of ORCs
compared to ACs. The PPs are more difficult to process than the NPs when put in
isolation. However, the PPs become much easier while the NPs more difficult
when they appear in the clauses. Evidently, the processing pattern reversal
results much from the same context in which the two different elements occur.</p>
