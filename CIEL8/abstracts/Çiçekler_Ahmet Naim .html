COMPUND CLAUSES IN OLD ANATOLIAN TURKISH</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><b><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'><span lang=TR style='font-size:12.0pt'>It is indicated by some
researchers that in Western and Eastern group of Turkic Language there is
genitive case assignment, but this process of assignment is made in different
ways. Miyagawa (2008) mentions there are two different genitive case
assignments in Altaic languages. One is C-licensing, the other is D-licensing.
And Modern Turkish belongs to the C-licensing catetogry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'><span lang=TR style='font-size:12.0pt'>In structures of Modern Turkish
showing nominal coherence, the inner clause subject is assigned with genitive
case. In other words, the inner clause subject is assigned with genitive case
as a result that the inner clause predicate taking –DIk, -AcAk, and –mA
morphemes takes a possessive suffix coherent with the subject. Miyagawa (2008)
shows Modern Turkish within the category of Tüm-assigning languages. The
process of assigning the inner clause subject with genitive case takes place in
inner clause.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'><span lang=TR style='font-size:12.0pt'>Another issue related to the
assignment of genitive case in Modern Turkish is that supposing the processes
mentioned above take place within the inner clause, it is obligatory for the
inner clause subject to be assigned with genitive case. In Old Anatolian
Turkish, genitive case assignment occurs with morphemes –DIk, and –AcAk. The
inner clause predicate nominalized with these two morphemes has a harmony with
its subject by taking a possessive suffix coherent with the subject; and as a
consequence of this harmony, the process of assigning the inner clause subject
with genitive case takes place. That is to say, just like in Modern Turkish,
genitive case assignment occurs with processes taking place within the inner
sentence. Accordingly, Old Anatolian Turkish, which is a historical period of
Modern Turkish, must be considered in Tüm-assigning languages. Because of the
reasons mentioned above, the assignment of inner clause subject with genitive
case in Old Anatolian Turkish shows similarity with Modern Turkish, but
genitive case assignment, contrary to Modern Turkish, is seen as a result of
studies to be used optionally. Whereas there is not nominative case assignment
in structures showing nominal coherence in Modern Turkish, it is seen in Old
Anatolian Turkish that structures showing nominal coherence are assigned also
with nominative case. Moreover, nominative case assignment is proportionately
more than genitive case assignment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'><span lang=TR style='font-size:12.0pt'>In 13th century texts the
subject is seen to be assigned with nominative and genitive cases in positions
where there is nominal coherence. When a comparison is made between two cases,
the frequency of nominative case (%78) is seen to be more than genitive case
(%22).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'><span lang=TR style='font-size:12.0pt'>In texts from 14th century, it
is seen that in inner clauses where there is nominal coherence the sentence is
assigned with %85 nominative and % 15 genitive cases in proportion. This
situation shows the appearance in 14th century has a dual structure. In
proportion to the previous century, as the main reason of the increase in
nominative case, we may put forward that –AcAK morpheme began to be used and it
chose mainly the nominative case.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'><span lang=TR style='font-size:12.0pt'>When texts from 15th century,
which is accepted to be the last period of Old Anatolian Turkish, are analyzed;
it was observed that nominative case is % 62 and genitive case is % 38.
Compared to 14th and 15th centuries, the rate of genitive case assignment in
sentences with nominal coherence increased clearly. This shows the case suffix
which the inner clause subject is assigned to became closer to genitive case.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'><span lang=TR style='font-size:12.0pt'>Miyagawa (2008) states about
Turkish that the inner clause subject is only assigned with genitive case; but
that situation is optional in Japanese, that is to say, both nominative and
genitive case assignments are possible. The optional situation between genitive
and nominative cases seen in Old Turkish is also observed in Old Anatolian
Turkish even if nominative case assignment is more in proportion. As a result,
predicates in Old Anatolian Turkish to which –DIk and–AcAk morphemes are added
have nominal coherence with their subjects. As a consequence of this coherence,
contrary to Modern Turkish, not the obligatory genitive case, but the optional
assignment of both two cases is possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'><span lang=TR style='font-size:12.0pt'>When we analyze the general
proportion of Old Anatolian Turkish, nominative case assignment is seen as % 73
and genitive case assignment is % 27. When sample sentences assigned with both
nominative and genitive cases are analyzed, no formal or syntactic difference
is encountered between them. This case supports the argument of Guzev and
Deniz-Yılmaz (1999) asserting some affixes are used optionally in Old Anatolian
Turkish, which is based on Melnikov’s principle Using Affixes Economically
(Eklerin Tasarruflu Kullanılması) in Turkish. Thus, as there is no parameter
about what situations are available for nominative and genitive case assignment
in structures showing nominal coherence, it can be stated that, in Old
Anatolian Turkish, the inner clause subject assigns either nominative or
genitive case optionally in structures showing nominal coherence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'><span lang=TR style='font-size:12.0pt'>Brieafly, genetive case in
Modern Turkish is assigned by –DIk, -AcAk and –mA when these morfems aggree
with the subject of inner clause. The genetive case assignmet occurs inside the
inner clause. Old Anatolian Turkish which is a historical period of Modern
Turkish shows parellelism with Modern Turkish in that the genetive case
assignmet occurs in inner clause also. In Old Anatolian Turkish genetive case
assignment is optional on contrary to Modern Turkish. In this study, under
which circumstances genetive case assignmet in Old Anatolian Turkish will be
examined.</span></p>
