<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:Calibri'>Native
speakers of a tone language (Mandarin) were trained to learning a more complex
tone system (Cantonese), with one group receiving training tone tokens with
larger variation and the other group with smaller variation. Performance before
and after training was measured using closed response-set identification and
pairwise discrimination tasks. Results show that the degree of speech variation
doesn’t affect the performance both identification and discrimination. Significant
improvement was found in tone identification following training, but not in
tone discrimination. Furthermore, segmental carriers show significant influence
on the tone performance. In particular, if the base syllables (segmental
carries without considering the tones) exist in Mandarin phonological system,
the performance boost in tone identification is significantly better than the
tone performance for those base syllables which do not exist in Mandarin phonological
system. Results indicate that both listeners’ native language experience and strategies
in performing the tasks affect the perception and acquisition of non-native
lexical tones.</span></p>
