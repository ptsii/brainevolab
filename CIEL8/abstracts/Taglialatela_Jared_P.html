<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:normal'>A
fundamental characteristic of human language is multimodality.&nbsp; In other
words, humans use multiple signaling channels concurrently when communicating
with one another.&nbsp; For example, people frequently produce manual gestures
while speaking, and the words a person perceives are impacted by visual
information.&nbsp; However, humans also have the ability to rely exclusively on
speech, allowing complex communication with individuals that are not in direct
view or physical proximity.&nbsp; This level of vocal control and flexibility
is unique among primates – and indeed exceedingly rare among mammals.&nbsp; It
is unclear what selection pressures led to this phylogenetically unprecedented
capacity for autonomous speech.&nbsp; Given that speech and the soft-tissue
that supports it do not leave well-preserved marks in the fossil record, the
study of variation in communicative behavior in extant nonhuman primates –
particularly chimpanzees and bonobos - is critical for understanding the
evolutionary origins of human sociality and communication. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:normal'>Despite
being closely related – diverging from a common ancestor only approximately 1
million years ago - bonobos and chimpanzees exhibit some notable behavioral
differences.&nbsp; One of the most striking, but least studied, differences
between these species are their vocal repertoires.&nbsp; We hypothesize that
differences between the <i>Pan</i> species’ feeding ecology may have favored
bonobos to become increasingly reliant on vocalizations, as opposed to other
modalities, to communicate with conspecifics and mediate social
interactions.&nbsp; Consequently, subsequent selection for increased vocal
control and flexibility occurred in bonobos as compared to chimpanzees – a
situation that may have been similar to the selection pressures faced by early
hominins. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:normal'>For this
talk, I will review species differences in the socio-communicative behaviors of
chimpanzees and bonobos and discuss the neurobiological and genetic foundations
for these complex social, cognitive, and communicative behaviors.</p>
