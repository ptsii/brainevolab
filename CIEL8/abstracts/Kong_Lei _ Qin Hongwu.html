font-family:Calibri'>The Development of Manner of Speaking Markers in English
and Chinese: Pragmaticalization, Grammaticalization, and Lexicalization</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left'><b><span

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The notions of lexicalization, grammaticalization and
pragmaticalization have been standing at the center of language change research
over the past decades. There are some instances of linguistic items that, at a
superficial glance, can be assigned grammatical, lexical or pragmatic status,
but such assignment might be problematic. For example, pragmatic markers are
not easy to be given such a status, and they have aroused a lot of attention as
well as controversies in linguistic literature.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Pragmatic markers, especially many phrasal markers, have
been seen as lexicalized because they show some degree of fusion (Schiffrin,
1987; Fischer, 2007). However, some others argue that, rather than being
lexicalized, they are grammaticalized because they have undergone many of the
changes characteristic of grammaticalization (Traugott, 1995; Traugott and
Dasher, 2002; Hopper and Traugott, 2003; Brinton and Traugott, 2005). There are
still other scholars argue that they undergone pragmaticalization rather than
grammaticalization because they have non-truth-conditional meaning and they function
pragmatically (Erman and Kotsinas, 1993; Aijmer, 1997). Different views on the
classification of pragmatic markers adds to the complexity of the issue. Maybe
it is far too general to understand the evolution of pragmatic markers by
saying it is a process of mere lexicalization, grammaticalization or
pragmaticalization. In fact, the processes do not run in parallelism; pragmaticalization
can be the underlying motivation for the other two processes. This assumption
is the basis on which this study observes the interplay among lexicalization,
grammaticalization and pragmaticalization.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>To explore the possible inter-relations among the
above-mentioned processes of language change, this study takes a close
examination on the development of manner of speaking markers (MSM for short) by
probing into the way in which English MSM <i>honestly</i> and Chinese MSM <i>shuoshihua</i>
(<i>to tell the truth)</i> evolve into pragmatic markers. Specifically, this
study attempts to address the following issues.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>a. The path of change involved in the evolution of
English and Chinese MSM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:35.35pt;text-align:left'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>b. The language universal and specific features
revealed in the evolution of English and Chinese MSM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>To make it usage-based, the study is aided by
empirical historical data. And the data are mainly from Google-books corpus
(English) and CCL corpus (Chinese).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;
text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The observation suggests that
English and Chinese MSM follow similar path in their development. Firstly, both
English and Chinese MSM have their origins in clause internal compositional
expressions (verb of speech + manner adv. / verb of speech + noun phrase). These
expressions with verbs of speech contain <span class=hps>a speaker perspective</span>,
thus they have a high potential to evolve into pragmatic markers and a high
possibility to become independent from the proposition. W<span class=hps>hen driven
by the pragmatic need of emphasizing manner of speaking,</span> t<span
class=hps>hese expressions</span> first experienced a syntactic change to a
more prominent <span class=hps>position by moving to the left </span>periphery<span
class=hps> of the sentence</span>. <span class=hps>This change involves
hierarchical reanalysis, a formal change leading to a new structure with
changed scope relations. </span>The change of syntactic position then brought<span
class=hps> a change of the syntactic behaviour of the verbs of speech (the
verbs of speech have undergone decategorization: from finite to non-finite)</span>.
<span class=hps>All these are typical features of grammaticalization and this </span>grammaticalization
is pragmatic-driven. <span class=hps>And the grammaticalized expressions
gradually become more condensed </span>with the push of pragmatic principle of
economy<span class=hps>, evolving into lexical forms or idiomatic expressions.
This is a process of lexicalization. In short, pragmatic motivation</span>
first led to grammaticalization of MSM, then their lexicalization.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;
text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Secondly,
grammaticalization and lexicalization of MSM would in turn promote their
pragmaticalization. For instance, change of syntactic position brought the
change of semantics of the expressions, enabling them to gain illocutionary
force. At the meantime, the conceptual meaning of the expressions became weaker
while their communicative meaning became more prominent. With increasing
frequency of use, the pragmatic function of the grammaticalized expressions
became more and more fixed, and their role as pragmatic markers strengthened.
Moreover, lexicalization of the expressions results in more condensed and
concise forms. Being concise is an important feature of pragmatic makers. In
this sense, lexicalization would also quicken the pace of pragmaticalization.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;
text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In short, diachronic data
from English and Chinese show that the evolution of MSM is a complex process
where Grammaticalization, pragmaticalization, and lexicalization are
interwoven.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;
text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>However</span><span
lang=ZH-CN style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:__'>_</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>English MSM and Chinese MSM demonstrate different
patterns of lexicalization. For English, it is the mechanism of metonymy that
leads to the formal reduction of a complex phrase to a single adverb. For
Chinese, the typical lexicalization pattern is the loss of semantic compositionality,
yet that process does not yield a one-word marker (like an adverb in English).
Considering that difference, we say English and Chinese MSM are in different
stages of lexicalization, with Chinese being less lexicalized, but only
idiomaticized. This shows that lexicalization of MSM is but one possible result
of grammaticalization and pragmaticalization. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:left;
text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The lexicalization of MSM
is affected by various factors, among which morphology might be the major one,
that is, the pattern and the degree of lexicalization of MSM are related to the
morphological features peculiar to a language. For instance, English, rich in
morphological devices, is more capable of conflating various conceptual
categories in lexical forms. While Chinese, a language short of morphological
devices, is less capable of doing that. Therefore, behind the universal laws of
lexicalization, there are typological variations concerning the pattern and degree
of lexicalization.</span></p>
