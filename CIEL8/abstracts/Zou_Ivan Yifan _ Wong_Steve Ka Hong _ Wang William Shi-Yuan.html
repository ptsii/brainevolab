the difference in dementia prevalence reported in various literatures, and
explore the potential reasons why such difference exists</span><span
style='font-family:Calibri;background:transparent'>; 2) to call attention to
the culture bias in both the dementia screening instruments and diagnostic criteria,
especially when they are adopted in the Chinese population. For the screening
instruments, the research provides a thorough review of different culture
biases in different versions of MMSE and MoCA and to make suggestion for a
better reliability for then; 3) to make clear the role</span><span

tools, but very little study does the same thing for diagnostic criteria. The
paper not only discuss the screening and diagnosis separately but also pay
attention to the more culture-neutral tools such as RUDAS &amp; CASI as well as
criteria such as 10/66</span><span style='font-family:Calibri'>;</span><span

style='font-family:Calibri'> in the study of music therapies for the dementia
patients: music is not treated with enough scientific seriousness. A general
picture in this academic area is that so long as a certain piece of music in a
certain genre works, no further examination into the music will be made.
Unfortunately, it is not a all's-well-that-ends-well Shakespeare’s play, many
scientific questions should be made, such as: if it is the Jazz music works,
why don’t other genres of music (classical music, rock, Chinese guqin and etc.)
work? Is it because the melodic or rhythmic structure in it? What specific type
of melodic line or rhythmic structure should the music therapists design? Are
there any rules for the therapist to follow? Questions like these are essential
towards a better understanding the nature and the power of the music in
dementia, however, very little literature has even touched upon them. </span><span
style='font-family:Calibri'>5) m</span><span style='font-family:Calibri'>usic
therapies are abundant, however, little has been adopted for the specific
benefit of people with dementia. The paper not only provides a comprehensive
review for the neurologic music therapies for the elderly people, but also
proposes the potential integration of MIT into the therapy for dementia. </span><span
style='font-family:Calibri'>6) </span><span style='font-family:Calibri'>So far,
little literature, even for those review articles, focus simultaneously on
dementia prevalence</span><span style='font-family:Calibri'>, </span><span

style='font-family:Calibri'>treatment and therapies. The merit of </span><span
style='font-family:Calibri'>integrating this line of research </span><span
style='font-family:Calibri'>is that it does not only provide a general picture
of dementia, but also makes a nice tracking of all the stages a dementia
patient might experience. </span></p>
