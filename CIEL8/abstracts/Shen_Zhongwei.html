<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Language Transmission, Language Acquisition, and
Dialect Formation</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The history of language is the history of language
transmission. The successful transmission of language relies on two basic facts:
the biologically determined language faculty of individuals and successful
language acquisition by individuals. The former is genetically or vertically
transmitted whereas the latter is culturally or horizontally transmitted. These
two transmissions involve very different time depth and different mechanisms,
so they must be separately studied in linguistics. While the study of formal
linguistics focuses on linguistic ability, the study of language acquisition
and the study of language history focus on how languages are passed down from
individual to individual and from generation to generation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Since the history of language is about language transmission,
we have to understand how languages are transmitted or acquired by individuals
in order to better our understanding of language history. It is necessary,
therefore, that the basic facts we observe in the study of language acquisition
must have their significance in the study of language history.</span></p>

<p class=Default style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='color:windowtext'>It
is well understood that second language learning is </span><span
style='color:black'>imperfect. Interlanguage (imperfectly learned language) is
a common, normal learning </span>result. The imperfection is largely from the
first language; this is exactly what we found in the Chinese dialects. Specific
dialectal features are often similar to the features of their linguistic
neighbors.</p>

<p class=Default style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Our analyses of Chinese dialects suggest
that different Chinese dialects are the results of imperfect learning of the
Chinese language throughout history by various groups of non-Chinese speakers
in different geographical regions. In retrospect it is inevitable that when the
Chinese language spreads into the non-Han language-speaking areas due to
political, cultural and linguistic pressures, non-Han people will drop their
language and gradually shift to the Chinese language. In the process their
first (non-Chinese) language features will inevitably be carried over to the
Chinese language they learned. The imperfectly learned Chinese language then becomes
a local variation, or a new Chinese dialect. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Based on the cross-language comparison and
multidisciplinary approach we would like to propose a new hypothesis: the
formation of Chinese dialects is through language shift. The Chinese dialects
are mainly various forms of imperfect learning by non-Chinese language speakers
historically. As the causes of the changes are external, the formation of
Chinese dialects is the result of cultural transmission or, in other words, the
result of “horizontal transmission”.</span></p>
