</span>Thefossil record, in concert with a comparative neuroanatomical analysisof closely related species, shows that the hominid brain increased insize more than 3-fold over a period of around 2.5 million years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other important qualitative changes occurredas well, though at least some would appear to be simple correlatedresponses to changes in overall size.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Inprinciple there are at least three ways to explain the increase: 1)unintentional side-effects of selection on other aspects of hominidbiology (some form of pleiotropic effect), 2) random change (geneticdrift), or 3) selection for some sort of increased behavioral ability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, given what we know about vertebratebiology and the evolutionary process in general, and about theevolutionary costs of neural tissue in particular, an adaptiveexplanation for these changes is the only likely answer.</p><p class="Indentnormal">If this dramatic increase in brain sizeoccurred because of selection for behavioral ability, then what kind ofbehavioral ability was selected for?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thisis the underlying question driving the research in this study.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suggestions such as hunting, tool-making,throwing, language, 'intelligence', and 'behavioral complexity' areoften found in introductory anthropology textbooks, but without anydirect empirical support.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is truethat all of these abilities differ in <i>Homo sapiens</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> as compared to other primates, all of themare quite complex in terms of the basic cognitive abilities theyrequire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are composed of a number ofsimpler, more basic cognitive processes, and are not properly thoughtof as self-contained, independent wholes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Forexample, hunting and throwing both involve 'spatial abilities' of somekind, and certainly involve the ability to form accurate visualrepresentations in the brain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tool makingrequires memory of a particular sequential order of actions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Language requires hierarchical thinking,associative memory, and a host of other basic cognitive abilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, it is unlikely that each of thesehigher-level cognitive abilities requires a unique set of lower-levelprocesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is, success at tool makingmight well depend on processes which also lend themselves to success atlanguage, for example.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Given this, weshould expect that selection for a complex behavioral ability (likelanguage) would result in better functioning lower-level processes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span></p><p class="Indentnormal">How might one delineate these simpler cognitiveprocesses experimentally?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Beginning withthe work of Francis Galton (a contemporary and cousin of CharlesDarwin), the discipline of differential psychology has focused on thedelineation of individual differences in various cognitive dimensions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One salient finding of this line of inquiryhas been that all tests that can be considered 'cognitive' (meaningthat they are not obviously related to physical strength, sensoryacuity, or other simple physical capacities) correlate with each othermuch more often than can be explained by chance with negativecorrelations being very rare, and never very large (Jensen 1987).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, various subsets of thesecognitive tests form natural clusters (i.e., are highly correlated withone another).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The most parsimoniousinterpretation of these findings is that different tests are tappingthe same set of underlying cognitive abilities, and these are thengiven descriptive labels (e.g., 'spatial ability') based on the typesof cognition they seem to require.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereare of course other interpretations, but this is a reasonable workingassumption.</p><p class="Indentnormal">While higher-level abilities, such as complexcooperative hunting, may well have been the immediate selective sieveunderlying hominid brain size evolution, it is unlikely that thereevolved a whole new set of brain nuclei devoted exclusively to thisability (the possible exception being language, but see below).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, a more plausible evolutionaryexplanation would suggest that basic cognitive processes improved withincreasing brain size, albeit under the selective sieve of one or moreof these complex behaviors, thereby improving a whole range of highercognitive functions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus a great amountof behavioral ability and complexity could have evolved without directand independent selection for each of the complex behaviors likelanguage and hunting.</p><p class="Indentnormal">The actual genetic, physiological mechanisms bywhich brain size increase occurred are not known.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Oneintriguing possibility is that point mutations increased theefficiency, speed, reliability, etc. of basic physiological processesthat play a key role in synaptic transmission and plasticity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For example, <i>N</i><span style="font-style: normal;">-methyl-</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">D</span>-aspartate (NMDA) receptors have beenimplicated in various forms of long-term learning and memory (Morrisand Davis 1994).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of differencesboth in the types of learning that NMDA receptors are associated with,as well as in the neuroanatomical locations where this learning occurs,it would appear that NMDA receptors function simply by detectingassociations between presynaptic and postsynaptic activity (Morris andDavis 1994).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since there is evidence thatsynaptic connections even in mature brains are use-dependent (see,e.g., Artola and Singer 1994), and further, since neuron cell death(which prunes back early developmental neuronal overproduction) is alsodependent on some form of use-dependent feedback (see Purves 1988), itis plausible that even small changes in the efficacy of basicphysiological pathways involved in synaptic transmission (such as thosein which NMDA receptors play a role) could result in increases inoverall neural volume.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, bymaking the feedback more effective, fewer neurons will be pruned in thefirst place and existing connections will spur even more synapticgrowth between existing neurons.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span style="font-size: 9pt;"><span style=""><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[3]<!--[endif]--></span></span></a></p><p class="Indentnormal">In any case, no matter how brain size increasewas accomplished, and no matter how complex behaviors are processed inthe brain, it is clear that if selection for one or more behavior isthe explanation for the increase in brain size in hominids (and/or anyof the other neuroanatomical differences seen in modern humans) weshould expect to find associations between variation in theseneuroanatomical features and variation in cognitive abilitiesassociated with these complex behaviors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereason for this follows from the logic of evolutionary change in theface of reproductive costs: this kind of change occurs only when astatistical reproductive advantage accrues to individuals who are moresimilar to the modern human condition for the trait in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only in those generations in which thisreproductive advantage accrues can there be any change in the populationcharacteristics of this trait.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,as the trait changes over time, its associated evolutionary costs willusually increase as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the traitin question no longer has any benefit, there will be selection againstit, thereby making any threshold effects (i.e., in which brain sizeincreases beyond some critical point have no effect on behavior)unlikely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This will be discussed in detailin the next chapters.</p><p class="Indentnormal">All of this suggests that there should be anassociation between the various neuroanatomical differences in modernhumans and some sort of increased behavioral ability, and it is thisquestion that is the focus of the present study.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Oneobvious place to start looking for correlates of neuroanatomicalvariability is in the basic dimensions of cognitive ability that havealready been delineated by psychologists, but a comparative perspectiveon brain-behavior relationships suggests additional possibilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A number of studies that have addressedvarious aspects of this question will be reviewed, and the unresolvedissues that form the rationale for this study will be highlighted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="Indentnormal">The present study extends the search forbehavioral correlates in three main ways.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First,it addresses the question of whether brain size has an actual causaleffect on behavioral differences, instead of just being correlated withthem because of common environmental influences, or because of variousmating patterns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Second, the range ofbehavioral dimensions addressed has been expanded to include areas ofspecific interest to theories of behavioral evolution (includingcognitive tasks that activate pre-frontal cortical tissue and basiccomponents of linguistic processing).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally,the possible effect of rate-of-maturation as a counterbalancing 'cost'of the evolution of brain size is addressed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inaddition, measurement of various neuroanatomical variables wasaccomplished through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), using a protocolwhich results in an almost 4-fold improvement in a spatial resolutioncompared to the next-highest resolution MRI/behavior study published todate. </p><p class="Indentnormal">Specifically, I have investigated the within-and between-family relationships in normal individuals between: 1)various aspects of brain anatomy derived from high resolution magneticresonance imaging (MRI), and 2) a wide variety of cognitive abilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Precise measurements of overall brain volume,volume of the cerebrum, volume of the gray and white matter regions ofthe cerebrum, volume of the brain stem and cerebellum, as well as ameasure of gray/white matter differentiation, were extracted from MRIbrain scans performed on 36 pairs of sisters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Theinterrelationships between these neuroanatomical variables and adiverse array of cognitive/behavioral dimensions were calculated usinga variety of statistical techniques.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Theresults suggest that there are no simple answers to the basic questionsof hominid neuroanatomical evolution.</p></div><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times;"><br clear="all" style="page-break-before: always;"></span><div class="Section2"><p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--></p></div><div style=""><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><br clear="all"><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"><!--[endif]--><div style="" id="ftn1"><p class="MsoFootnoteText"><a style="" href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title=""><span style="font-size: 9pt;"><span style=""><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[1]<!--[endif]--></span></span></a>Williams(1966) p. 16.</p></div><div style="" id="ftn2"><p class="MsoFootnoteText"><a style="" href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title=""><span style="font-size: 9pt;"><span style=""><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[2]<!--[endif]--></span></span></a>Gould(1989) p. 319.</p></div><div style="" id="ftn3"><p class="MsoFootnoteText"><a style="" href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title=""><span style="font-size: 9pt;"><span style=""><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[3]<!--[endif]--></span></span></a>Onecorollary of this idea would be that NMDA receptors should be moreeffective, and/or there should be a greater density of them, than inother animals.<br></p><p class="MsoFootnoteText"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Copyright 1997 by Paul ThomasSchoenemann</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;<br></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><br></span></p></div></div></body></html>
