Some linguists (e.g., Bickerton 1990)have argued that, although language was made possible by our largebrain, size does not have a direct influence on ability once a certaincritical mass is obtained (i.e., either the circuit is there or itisn't). </p><p class="Indentnormal3">On the other hand, it may be that the numberof circuits devoted to a task does relate to ability.  (Raz, <i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1987), after showing that a very simpleauditory recognition task correlates strongly with IQ (</span><i>r=</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.68, </span><i>p&lt;</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.05) suggest that redundancy of neuralcomponents aids in the resolution of a detection system.  They note thatthere are only about 2,000-4,500 hair cells in the cochlea of the earthat fire in response to vibration at different frequencies, but thatthis increases to 10 million neurons in the primary auditory area ofthe cortex (Green and Wier 1984). Larger numbers of neurons andorganized in a hierarchical fashion would be the most plausible way toincrease the resolution of noisy, imperfect signals (Raz, </span><i>etal.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1987).  Greater resolution atone level means faster information processing at the next higherhierarchical level.  As discussed in the previous chapter, Calvin (1982,1983a) points out that by geometrically increasing the number ofneurons (or neural units) operating in parallel, neural timing accuracyis increased.  He suggests that throwing might have been the initialimpetus to increased brain size, after which language (and perhaps othercognitive abilities) was able to utilize the increased sequentialtiming abilities that this increase allowed.  Both of these modelssuggest ways in which an increase in neural tissue may relate, directlyor indirectly, to individual differences in cognitive abilities. </span></p><p class="Indentnormal3">&nbsp;</p><h2><a name="_Toc494464101"></a><a name="4.2">4.2  A Key FunctionalArea: The Frontal Lobes</a></h2><p class="Indentnormal3">As indicated in chapter 2, the pre-frontalcortex in humans is about twice as large as would be expected given aprimate brain of that size (Deacon 1988b).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; vertical-align: super;">[1]</span></a> Our brainas a whole is several times larger than one would expect given our bodysize. This means that the increase in size of the prefrontal cortexaccounts for much more of the total increase in brain size that occurredduring human evolution than other areas of the brain.  The frontallobes are known to be crucial in all sorts of "higher level" cognitiveabilities (e.g. "planning"), but they also play a key role in memory ofsequential order.  Human patients with prefrontal cortex lesions areunable to remember information regarding the temporal aspects of theirenvironment.  They cannot plan and execute a complex set of motormovements, program a set of activities in correct temporal order, orremember the order of experiences (Fuster 1985, Milner <i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1985, 1991, Struss and Benson 1986, Squire1987). Frontal cortex damaged patients cannot remember the order ofpresentation of pictures or words but they can remember that the itemswere previously presented (Milner 1971).  They also show difficultiesordering words into sentences and detecting grammatical errors (Novoaand Ardila 1987). </span></p><p class="Indentnormal3">What is perhaps most interesting is that thissame dissociation between item memory and order memory (with memory ofsequential order localized in the frontal lobes) has been demonstratedin monkeys (Petrides 1991, Squire 1987) and even rats (Kesner andHolbrook 1987, Kesner 1990).  The fact that the prefrontal cortexappears to be specifically involved in memory for serial order inspecies as far removed from humans as rats suggests that thisspecialization is very old (primate-rodent common ancestry dates to ~65MYA; Sarich 1985).  It appears that, at least in some respects, thehuman brain has not undergone a drastic restructuring, nor has itevolved a unique set of functional sub-units, but rather it has simplyemphasized certain basic cortical functions that had evolved millions ofyears earlier and are apparently widespread. </p><p class="Indentnormal3">Humans excel at understanding (and make useof) cause and effect relationships.  This fact may be the most importantreason humans are so adept at manipulating the environment (social orotherwise) to their advantage.  In fact, one could argue that theprocess of reasoning is nothing more than an analysis of cause andeffect relationships.  But in order to utilize cause and effectrelationships, the organism must be able to remember which actions causewhich effects: i.e., the organism must be able to remember a specifictemporal sequence.  Given the bias in brain size increase in thefrontal lobes during human evolution, they are a natural place to lookfor behavioral correlates to individual differences. </p><p class="Indentnormal3">This may also have important implications forthe evolution of syntax (Schoenemann and Wang 1996).  Although Bickerton(1990) argues that syntax is not simply word order, languagecommunication necessarily occurs through a serial channel (Pinker andBloom 1991).  While it is true that some languages, e.g., Latin, makeless use of serial order in their syntax, ALL languages neverthelessdisplay some form of word order constraint.  Syntax must involve ruleswhich translate a multi-dimensional idea or set of relationships into asingle dimension.  Word order is commonly used to convey theserelationships. Without the ability to pay attention to sequential order,it would be impossible to learn most languages.</p><p class="Indentnormal3">&nbsp;</p><h2><a name="_Toc494464102"></a><a name="4.3">4.3  The Meaning ofVariation within Modern Human Populations</a></h2><p class="Indentnormal3">As discussed in chapter 2, there is a widerange of variation in brain size (and presumably in the otherneuroanatomical features outline above) in modern humans. <i>A priori</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, this variation might or might not berelated to behavioral differences.  If it is not, it would mean that thebenefits to larger brains are not behavioral. Alternatively, one mightargue that brain size was indeed adaptive in the past, but is no longeradaptive in modern populations (Martin Daly, personal communication).Perhaps behavioral differences are not related to amount of braintissue available to the individual beyond a certain critical brainsize. </span></p><p class="Indentnormal3">The problem with this scenario is that itignores the evolutionary costs associated with larger brain size.  Ifincreasing brain size has less and less influence on behavioral ability,while at the same time it has greater and greater associated costs, thebalance point between increasing costs and decreasing benefits wouldnecessarily occur significantly prior to the point at which brain sizeno longer has any meaningful behavioral implications. For thishypothesis to work, therefore, it is necessary for there to be noadditional evolutionary cost associated with increasing brain sizebeyond the very same critical threshold at which brain size becomesirrelevant to behavior.  If this were not the case, selection wouldoperate to limit brain size to the critical threshold and therebydramatically restrict brain size variability around this criticalthreshold. Since there does not seem to be any good reason why we shouldexpect the evolutionary costs to have a critical threshold to beginwith (let alone the same threshold as behavioral ability), thishypothesis must be seen as post-hoc and inherently unlikely. The mostreasonable starting assumption must be that brain size variation hasbehavioral implications even within modern humans.  This is of courseentirely an empirical question, and the research presented below is afurther investigation of this possibility.</p><p class="Indentnormal3">&nbsp;</p><h2><a name="_Toc494464103"></a><a name="4.4">4.4  Attempts to FindBehavioral Correlates of Neuroanatomical Variation within Species</a></h2><p class="Indentnormal3">The abilities generally subsumed under therubric "intelligence," (e.g., the ability to solve problems, togeneralize concepts from specific events, to think analytically, to uselanguage, to learn, and so forth) all seem to relate, at least loosely,to the behavioral differences between humans and other animals.However, exactly how we should measure intelligence is an extremelycontentious question.  The fact that we have not found a test thateveryone agrees perfectly measures intelligence has led some to arguethat our concept of intelligence does not actually exist in the realworld. However, it is more likely that the concept of intelligence is socontentious not because intelligence does not exist, but simply becauseit is so very important to us: those who are high in intelligence haveclear advantages in our society (see, e.g., Herrnstein and Murray1994).  In any case, it is instructive to look at what evidence we dohave with regard to the correlation between correlates of intelligence,measured in admittedly imperfect ways, and neuroanatomical variables.</p><p class="Indentnormal3">&nbsp;</p><h3><a name="_Toc494464104"></a><a name="4.4.1">4.4.1  Evidence fromNon-Human Species</a></h3><p class="Indentnormal3">First, we should look at the evidence fromother species.  It has been known for some time that species differ withrespect to various cognitive domains.  Some of these domains clearly donot depend on brain size.  Echolocation in bats, for example, is anextremely sophisticated neurological adaptation (Jerison 1985). Upwards of 200 ultrasonic impulses are emitted (and an equivalentnumber of echoes have to be processed) per second at crucial times,allowing bats to create a three-dimensional map of their environmentbased on the characteristics of the returning echoes (Griffin 1958,Dawkins 1986).  However, bats accomplish this without large overallbrain sizes (Jerison 1985).</p><p class="Indentnormal3">On the other hand, some types of behavior doappear to correlate with brain size.  Because of difficulties in findingbehavior patterns which are directly comparable across broad groups ofspecies, Macphail (1982 ) has argued that it is not possible to makeany judgments about the relative "intelligence" of various groups ofspecies.  However, this is not the relevant question.  Given that braintissue is very expensive (for the reasons outlined in chapter 3), weshould expect that there be some benefit to it. Whatever behavioraldifferences correlate with brain size differences across species areprobable clues to the benefits to increasing brain size.  In otherwords, it matters not whether we can make any meaningful judgmentsabout relative intelligence between species, as long as we find somebehavioral correlate with brain size.  We can then call this behavioraldimension intelligence, or anything we want. </p><p class="Indentnormal3">Rensch (1956) attempted to circumvent theproblems that Macphail (1982) has outlined by comparing closely relatedspecies which vary in brain size.  He points to a number of instances inwhich species-typical behavior patterns (for example, mating displays)tend to be more complicated in larger species (with larger brain sizes)than in closely related smaller species.  The same sort of effect hasbeen shown for a number of closely related bird species in generallearning capacity (number of different visual cues for whichassociations can be learned), as well as the length of time that suchcues and there learned associations can be remembered (Rensch 1956). Healso showed that larger brained ungulates (i.e., elephants) displayedbetter discrimination learning than smaller brained ungulates (such aszebras; Rensch 1957).  These generalities have many individualexceptions, however.</p><p class="Indentnormal3">Miller and Tallarico (1974) attempted toextend Rensch's (1956, 1957) argument to perceptual problem-solving,involving detour behavior, in small and large brained species in thefamily Columbidae (ring doves and pigeons, respectively).  Even thoughring doves have brains roughly half as big as pigeons in absolute terms(ring doves: 1.13 g; pigeons: 2.38 g), there was no difference in any ofthe detour-learning measures between the species.  The significance ofthis finding is simply that detour behavior is not related to brainsize in these species.  As pointed out above, the question should be,what behavioral differences are there between these species?  This wasnot addressed by the study (which understandably focused on one type ofbehavior).</p><p class="Indentnormal3">Riddell and Corl (1977) showed that speciesdifferences in a variety of learning tasks correlated strongly withbrain size (and relative brain size).  While the number of data pointswas small (e.g., the largest comparison, involving learning sets,included only 11 species), it does suggest that there are general,cross-species behavioral dimensions which are associated with brain size.</p><p class="Indentnormal3">Behavioral correlations have also been foundat the level of specific brain structures.  Devoogd <i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (1993) demonstrated a significantassociation across 41 species of oscine birds between the size of thebrain nuclei related to song production and the size of the songrepertoire displayed by the species. Species with larger HVC ("highvocal center") nuclei in relation to overall telencephalon volumestended to use a larger variety of songs.  The correlation was </span><i>r=</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.56 (</span><i>p&lt;</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.001), and was independent ofphylogenetic relationships among the birds (though this is a dubiousevolutionary explanation in any case</span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; vertical-align: super;">[2]</span></a>).</p><p class="Indentnormal3">Studies have also shown that the size of thehippocampus (a structure in the medial temporal lobe) is related to thedegree to which spatial knowledge is a key component of a speciessurvival. In the study mentioned in the discussion of spatial abilitydifferences between the sexes, Jacobs <i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (1990) report that the polygynous meadowvole (</span><i>Microtus pennsylvanicus</i><span style="font-style: normal;">) shows significantly greater sexualdimorphism in hippocampus volume (relative to overall brain volume) thandoes the monogamous pine vole (</span><i>Microtus pinetorum</i><span style="font-style: normal;">). Overall brain volume differences,however, apparently show a different pattern.  Jacobs </span><i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (1990) do not provide the raw data, but itis possible to derive from their figure 1 the necessary numbers tocalculate average brain volumes for males and females in each species.While meadow voles have larger brain volumes overall than pine voles(~630 mm</span><span style="font-size: 9pt; vertical-align: super;">3</span>vs. ~500 mm<span style="font-size: 9pt; vertical-align: super;">3</span>,respectively, for average of male and female means), male brains wereonly 1.6% larger than females in meadow voles but were ~8 % larger inpine voles.  Jacobs <i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;">(1990) state that neither of the within-sex differences in brain volumewere statistically significant, however.  This indicates that overallbrain size is not related to spatial processing in these species.</span></p><p class="Indentnormal3">Comparisons of the bannertail kangaroo rat (<i>Dipodomysspectabilis</i><span style="font-style: normal;">), which hoards seedsin its own burrow, with Merriam's kangaroo rat (</span><i>Dipodomysmerriami</i><span style="font-style: normal;">), which hoards food inspatially scattered locations, show that the hippocampus issignificantly larger in this latter species (Sherry </span><i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1992).</span></p><p class="Indentnormal3">The association of hippocampal volume andspatial ability has also been shown in birds.  Black-capped chickadeesstore food in spatially distributed cache sites, but their ability torecover cached food can be disrupted by aspiration lesion of thehippocampus (Sherry <i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;">1992). Comparisons of food-storing with non-food-storing passerine birdspecies, both from North America and Europe, have shown thatfood-storers have hippocampi more than twice the size expected for birdswith their telencephalon size and body weight (Sherry </span><i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1992).  Since the food-storers are notmore closely related to each other than they are to non-food-storers,this finding cannot be explained as a case of phylogenetic conservatism(which, again, is a dubious evolutionary explanation in any case). </span></p><p class="Indentnormal3">However, the exact nature of the spatialability presumed to be mediated by the hippocampus in these birds is notclear, since studies of hippocampus size and migratory path length(which obviously requires some form of spatial ability) have shown noassociation (Sherry <i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;">1992). Studies of homing pigeons suggest that the type of spatialability mediated by the hippocampus has to do with the ability to usefamiliar local cues for orientation.  Most pigeons with hippocampallesions never reach home, even though they orient correctly whenreleased. Furthermore, the hippocampus of homing pigeons is larger thanthat of pigeons that have not been breed for homing ability (seereferences in Sherry </span><i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1992). </span></p><p class="Indentnormal3">Finally, there have been two interestingwithin-species studies on this question, both done on rats.  The firstinvolved looking at the brain sizes of two different lineages of ratssubjected to 11 generations of selection for either enhancedmaze-running ability or decreased maze-running ability (Hamilton 1935).The resulting "maze-bright" and "maze-dull" groups differed by more than~3.5 standard deviations in maze-running scores. Significantly, thesetwo strains differed more in brain size than in any otheranthropometric variable: ~2.5 standard deviations (compared to, e.g.,~1.2 standard deviations in body weight).  More recently, Anderson(1993) has shown in rats that a general factor derived from performanceon a set of behavioral tasks correlates <i>r=</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.48 with brain size.</span></p><p class="Indentnormal3">&nbsp;</p><h3><a name="_Toc494464105"></a><a name="4.4.2">4.4.2  Evidence inHumans</a></h3><h4><a name="4.4.2.1">4.4.2.1 Clinical Populations</a></h4><p class="Indentnormal3">If brain size has a causal effect on behavior,we should find that damage to the brain causes decreased behavioralability, and further that the degree of damage is at least looselyassociated with the degree of behavioral deficit.  Such findings wouldnot prove that the amount of brain tissue in normal individuals isbehaviorally relevant. of course.  We know that there are structuralfeatures of the brain besides overall size that are critical tobehavioral function.  One could potentially have all the key structuralpathways and networks, yet have fewer neurons subserving each area.Brain damage might be causing behavioral deficits by knocking out ordisrupting pathways, with a greater amount of damage affecting a greaternumber of pathways, even though, under this hypothesis, the totalnumber of neurons is not relevant.  However, while an associationbetween the degree of brain damage and the degree of behavioral deficitdoes not prove that brain size is causally related to behavior, theopposite finding, if generally true, would suggest that brain size is <i>not</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> causally related to behavior. </span></p><p class="Indentnormal3">In fact, the results of a number of studies ofdifferent types of brain damage and disease, including Williamssyndrome, Down syndrome, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, andschizophrenia, are consistent with the idea that a decrease in theamount of neural tissue is associated with behavioral deficits.  Thesestudies use MRI or related techniques to estimate the degree of braindamage or brain size. </p><p class="Indentnormal3">In general, mentally retarded children havesmaller heads than average (Broman <i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1987, Hack </span><i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1991).  Jernigan and Bellugi (1990) foundthat both Williams and Down syndrome patients had significantly loweroverall brain volume than normals of roughly the same ages.  Both ofthese patient groups display significant mental retardation, with IQ'saveraging ~50 (3.3 standard deviations below the mean; Bellugi et al1990). Estimating from the reported voxel counts in Jernigan and Bellugi(1990)</span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; vertical-align: super;">[3]</span></a>, the 6Williams syndrome patients had an average brain size of 1058 cm<span style="font-size: 9pt; vertical-align: super;">3</span> and the 3 Downsyndrome patients averaged 991 cm<span style="font-size: 9pt; vertical-align: super;">3</span>.  By contrast,the 14 normals in the study averaged 1326 cm<span style="font-size: 9pt; vertical-align: super;">3</span>. Thesedifferences are highly significant, though there was a difference inaverage age of about 3 years between the normal (mean age 19) and bothpatient groups (mean age 15.8 for Williams and 16 for Downs syndromepatients). However, brain size in normal 13 to 15 year olds is alreadymore than 95% of the mean brain size for normal 19 to 21 year olds(Dekaban and Sadowsky 1978). In comparison, the Williams syndromepatients in Jernigan and Bellugi's (1990) study averaged less than 80%of the normals, and the Down syndrome patients averaged less than 75% ofthe normals.  Thus, there is an association in between brain volume andmental retardation, though this is of course not proof that the brainsize decrease is actually causing the IQ deficits.</p><p class="Indentnormal3">Studies of Alzheimer's patients havedemonstrated correlations between different neuroanatomical componentsand behavioral dimensions.  Kesslak <i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (1991) found correlations between MRIdetermined hippocampal volumes in Alzheimer's patients and a number ofcognitive tests, including Mini-Mental State ("general cognitiveability") (</span><i>r=</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.90),Smell Identification Test (</span><i>r=</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.73), Olfactory Match-to-Sample (</span><i>r=</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.74), and Visual Match-to-Sample (</span><i>r=</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.27).  They also found correlationsbetween MRI determined parahippocampal volumes and the same tests(Mini-Mental State, </span><i>r=</i><span style="font-style: normal;">0.91; Smell Identification Test, </span><i>r=</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.66; Olfactory Match-to-Sample, </span><i>r=</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.73; and Visual Match-to-Sample, </span><i>r=</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.35).  These correlations are inflatedbecause of pooling of dichotomized groups (8 Alzheimer's patients and 7normals) but still indicate a strong relationship between hippocampalvolume and behavioral ability in this disease.  In another Alzheimer'sstudy, Rusinek </span><i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;">(1991) found a correlation between "global dementia score" (a measure ofthe degree of severity of dementia) with the percentage of brain volumethat is grey matter (</span><i>r</i><span style="font-style: normal;">=-0.55,</span><i>p</i><span style="font-style: normal;">&lt;0.01), in 14 ambulatory AD patients </span></p><p class="Indentnormal3">Similar findings have been found for multiplesclerosis patients.  Swirsky-Sacchetti <i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (1992) found correlations in 40 MSpatients between "Lesion Area" in various regions (as assessed from MRIscans by neuroradiologists) and several cognitive tests (corrected forage and education effects).

However, other abilitiesincluding IQ deficit, verbal memory, visual memory, and visual attentiondid not showing significant correlations .  Franklin </span><i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (1988) correlated "whole brain lesionscores" for 60 MS patients (mixed sex) and various behavioral measuresincluding: "Trails A" (</span><i>r=</i><span style="font-style: normal;">0.47, </span><i>p&lt;</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.0001),"Trails B" (</span><i>r=</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.43, </span><i>p&lt;</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.00?), "Verbal Learning" (</span><i>r=</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.36, </span><i>p&lt;</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.005), "Non-verbal Learning" (</span><i>r=</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.35, </span><i>p&lt;</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.01), "Visual Naming" (</span><i>r=</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.34, </span><i>p&lt;</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.01), "Verbal Memory" (</span><i>r=</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.31, </span><i>p&lt;</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.01), "Figure Copying" (</span><i>r=</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.31, </span><i>p&lt;</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.01), "Symbol Digit Modalities" (</span><i>r=</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.29, </span><i>p&lt;</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.05), and "Numerical Attention-Time" (</span><i>r=</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.28, </span><i>p&lt;</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.05).

Zipursky (1992) segmented grey and white matter forvarious subregions of the brain in 22 schizophrenics (and 20 normals)and found a significant correlation within the schizophrenics betweenthe percentage of the intracranial volume that was grey matter and thedegree of emotional withdrawal (as indexed by the Brief PsychiatricRating Scale Withdrawal-Retardation factor; <i>r=</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> -0.47, </span><i>p&lt;</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.05).  Schlaepfer </span><i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (1994) reported that schizophrenics hadsignificantly less gray matter volume in their heteromodal associationcortex (i.e., dorsolateral prefrontal, inferior parietal including thesupramarginal and angular gyri, and the superior temporal gyrus).</span></p><p class="Indentnormal3">In addition, Rushton and Ankney (1996) reviewseven studies of clinical populations which correlated MRI-derivedvolume estimates (four studies estimated overall brain size, two used asubset of the total set of slices, and one estimated frontal lobe size)with various IQ tests (though one study used educational level as aproxy). The <i>N</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> - weighted meancorrelation was </span><i>r=</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.22.Thus, there is substantial evidence from clinical populations thatbehavioral deficits are associated with smaller brain size and/orneuroanatomical damage or disease.</span></p><p class="Indentnormal3">&nbsp;</p><h4><a name="4.4.2.2">4.4.2.2 Studies of Normal Individuals</a> </h4><p class="Indentnormal3">The empirical studies of the relationshipbetween brain size and behavior have focused almost exclusively on theconcept of general intelligence.  The idea that more intelligent peoplehave larger brains has a long history.  The earliest attempt to testthis was carried out by the inventor of the product-moment correlation:Karl Pearson.  Pearson (1906) compared the grades of 1011 universitystudents to linear measurements of their cranial size (controlled forbody size) and found a correlation of  only 0.11, which was neverthelessstatistically significant.  Wickett <i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (1994) reviewed 25 studies involving 39independent samples and obtained an N-weighted mean correlation of r=0.194 (total N=51,931) between IQ estimates and head circumference. VanValen (1974) pointed out that if brain size and intelligence were trulyfunctionally related, then the correlations between IQ and headdimensions would necessarily be attenuated because head dimensions areimperfect measures of brain size and IQ is an imperfect measure ofintelligence. In other words, if brain size and intelligence really arecorrelated, then as more accurate measures of brain size andintelligence obtained on a group of subjects, the size of thecorrelations would necessarily increase. </span></p><p class="Indentnormal3">Several recent studies have shown that brainsize estimated <i>in vivo</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> usingMRI or CAT scan data correlates with differences in IQ test scores atabout r= 0.42, which is more than twice as large as the average foundfor studies using head circumference as a proxy (Willerman </span><i>etal.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1991, Andreasen </span><i>etal.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1990, 1993, Raz </span><i>etal.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1993, Harvey </span><i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1994, Wickett </span><i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1994, Egan </span><i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1994, 1995, Pearlson 1989; see Rushton andAnkney 1996 for a review).  One of these studies (Willerman </span><i>etal.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1991) included correlationsbetween IQ and two different measures of brain size: 1) outsidecircumference of the skull, and 2) brain size derived from MagneticResonance Imaging (which provides the best estimate of brain size inliving humans).  The circumference vs. IQ correlation was 0.17 while theMRI vs. IQ correlation was 0.35.  These studies suggest thatMRI-derived brain size estimates explain about 4 times as much of thevariance in IQ than does head circumference, which is further supportfor the reality of brain/behavior correlations in modern humans.  Thesefindings confirm Van Valen's (1974) estimate and strongly suggest thatrelationships between true brain size and true "intelligence" are likelyto be significantly attenuated. It is as yet unknown whether certainsubdivisions of the brain are more highly correlated with IQ thanothers (cortical as opposed to sub-cortical regions, for instance). </span></p><p class="Indentnormal3">However, just as cranial size is an imperfectestimate of true brain size, it is also known that "intelligence" isimperfectly sampled by IQ tests.  Not only do IQ tests vary inreliability, but they also reflect aspects of mental ability that werenot directly selected for during human evolution (but which we haveincreasingly put to use in more recent times).  It is possible thatcertain basic properties of the brain were selected for (e.g. theability to remember in detail the serial order of past events whichwould increase the ability to determine cause and effect relationships)which then may have led to a general size increase, thereby opening thedoor for the development of other cognitive abilities (e.g., language).</p><p class="Indentnormal3">There is, to my knowledge, only one publishedstudy of the relationship between several different behavioraldimensions and brain size.  Susanne (1979) correlated circumference ofthe skull with 5 different psychometric tests (Raven's progressivematrices, and tests of vocabulary, arithmetic, geometrical volumerecognition, and elementary and technical knowledge) on a sample of2,071 Belgian male conscripts.  All the correlations with brain sizewere highly significant (<i>p</i><span style="font-style: normal;">&lt;0.001).The highest correlation to brain size was with a composite sum of all 5psychometric tests (</span><i>r</i><span style="font-style: normal;">=0.242), followed by the arithmetic test (</span><i>r</i><span style="font-style: normal;">= 0.233), the vocabulary test (</span><i>r</i><span style="font-style: normal;">= 0.226), the test of elementary andtechnical knowledge (</span><i>r</i><span style="font-style: normal;">=0.199), Raven's progressive matrices (</span><i>r</i><span style="font-style: normal;">= 0.185), and the test of geometricalvolume recognition (</span><i>r</i><span style="font-style: normal;">=0.165). What is perhaps most interesting about this study is the factthat the composite of all these tests was the most highly correlatedwith brain size (although the statistical significance of thedifferences in correlations is not given).  The implication is thatbrain size is more highly correlated with the ability to do well on allthese tests than it is with any single behavioral dimension. However,since a factor analysis was not run on the data to separate out </span><i>g</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (i.e., that portion of the individualvariance that is common to a set of tests) from other behavioraldimensions tapped by each test, and since circumference was used insteadof </span><i>in vivo</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> brain size,these results are difficult to interpret.</span></p><p class="Indentnormal3">There is also evidence that variability incorpus callosum cross-sectional area in normal individuals correlateswith cognitive abilities. Hines <i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (1992) found two major morphologicalprincipal components (corresponding essentially to anterior andposterior portions of the corpus callosum) and three major cognitiveprincipal components (verbal fluency, degree of lateralization oflanguage, and visuospatial ability) in a sample of 28 normalindividuals. They found that the posterior callosal factor correlated at </span><i>r=</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.55 with the verbal fluency factor (</span><i>p&lt;</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.01) and </span><i>r=</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> -0.32 with the language lateralizationfactor (</span><i>p&lt;</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.05). Theanterior callosal factor correlated at </span><i>r=</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.37 with the visuospatial factor (</span><i>p&lt;</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.05).  However, one well known test ofspatial ability - mental rotation (Vandenberg and Kuse 1978) - did </span><i>not</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> correlate significantly with any portionof corpus callosum cross-sectional area.  This indicates that at leastsome neuroanatomical components are also correlated significantly withcognitive ability.</span></p><p class="Indentnormal3">Lastly, it should be pointed out that thereappear to be differences in brain anatomy that relate to differences inspecific abilities. At the cytoarchitectural level the degree ofdendritic arborization (i.e., number of higher order branches of thedendrites of neurons) there are differences between the left and righthemispheres, and between opercular (Broca's area) and precentral (motorstrip) areas (Scheibel 1984).  Since the opercular region in the lefthemisphere is known to be important in speech processing, this suggeststhat there are cytoarchitectural differences which are associated withbehavioral differences, at least within the cortex.  It should be noted,however, that the sample size of this study was very small (<i>N</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> = 8).  Jacobs </span><i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (1993b) report that a number of aspects ofdendritic branching in Wernicke's area differ by educational level andby sex.  Those with more education had greater total dendritic length,greater mean dendritic length (average length of each dendriticsegment), and more dendritic segments overall than those with lesseducation. That is, those with more education had richer and more densedendritic branching.  Extrapolating to other cortical areas, one cansuggest a general manner by which brain size would correlated withbehavioral ability.  The extent to which the findings reported by Jacobs </span><i>etal.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (1993b) are causes or effectsof more education is not known.     Jacobs </span><i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (1993b) also show that females had richerand more dense dendritic branching on average than males. Given thatfemales also do better on various tasks of verbal fluency (Kimura1992), this finding is also consistent with the idea that localdifferences in dendritic branching correlate with functional differencesin behavior.</span></p><p class="Indentnormal3">Scheibel (1984) further reports unpublisheddata from Oscar and Cecile Vogt on cortical layers (lamina) in twobrains from individuals with known talents.  One, from an artist with alifetime capacity for eidetic imagery, had a lamina IV in his primaryvisual cortex (Brodmann area 17) that appeared twice as large asungifted controls.  The other, from a musician with absolute pitch, hada lamina IV from Heschl's gyrus (primary auditory cortex) that was atleast twice the size of the controls.  Scheibel reports that theseindividuals did not appear to have more neurons, but apparently hadgreater dendritic branching.  While two cases are not enough to concludeanything with confidence, these reports are consistent with thesuggestion that neuroanatomical differences (even at the level of theneuron) are associated with behavioral abilities.</p><p class="Indentnormal3">Further, Schlaug <i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (1995) reported that musicians withperfect pitch have greater leftward asymmetry of the portion of thecerebral cortex which directly subserves music-related abilities (i.e.,the planum temporale, a portion of the Wernicke's speech area).  Again,these studies indicate that neuroanatomical variability can havebehavioral correlates.</span></p><p class="Indentnormal3">&nbsp;</p><h4><a name="4.4.2.3">4.4.2.3 Potentially Inconsistent Evidence</a></h4><p class="Indentnormal3">There are two conditions in which brain sizesignificantly different than normal reportedly has no behavioralconsequence. The first involves midgets, who are claimed (Lenneberg1967) to have brains roughly the size of modern pongids, yet have"normal" language ability.  The word "normal" is in quotations becausewhat is actually claimed is that they have normal ability for children(Lenneberg 1967).  However, it is not clear on what basis these claimsare made.  There are, as far as I am aware, no detailed studies oflanguage ability, IQ, or any other cognitive dimension in midgets.</p><p class="Indentnormal3">One study looked at benign megalencephaly inchildren, in which head circumferences are greater than the 98thpercentile for their sex and age.  Lewis <i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (1989) compared nine such children totheir siblings, who had head circumferences within two standarddeviations from the mean for their age and sex.  The megalencephalicchildren were screened for diseases known to increase brain sizeabnormally, and were given CT scans to rule out such conditions ashydrocephally, etc.. They found no significant differences in IQ,vocabulary, or other tests of cognitive function between themegalencephalic children and their normal siblings.  However, there werea number of possible problems with the study. First, brain size was notdirectly determined: only head circumference was used.  Second,specific data on the siblings was not given.  Presumably the siblingstended to have larger head circumferences than average as well, even ifthey were within two standard deviations of the mean, such that thedifferences between the megalencephalic children and their siblings inhead circumference might not have been very large.  Third, the averageage of the subjects was only 8.6 years for the megalencephalic childrenand 7.9 years for the sibling group.  IQ in younger subjects shows someinstability when compared to IQ in 18 year olds (Neisser </span><i>etal.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1996).  Fourth, and mostimportantly, the megalencephalic children showed other problems thatindicate some sort of neurological problem.  They performedsignificantly worse than the sibling group on a test of motorproficiency, four of the nine had a history of speech problems, five hada history of motor problems, and two had a history of attentionalproblems. If these problems are due to an undiagnosed neurologicalproblem, this might also negatively affect scores on the cognitivetests, causing them to be lower than they might otherwise be.  If brainsize does correlate with behavioral ability in general, these subject'stest scores would reflect a trade-off between neurological problems(depressing them) and higher brain size (increasing them).  Thus, thisstudy provides only weak evidence against the idea that brain size iscorrelated with better cognitive test scores.</span></p></div><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Palatino;"><br clear="all" style="page-break-before: always;"></span><div class="Section2"><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p></div><div><br clear="all"><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"><div id="ftn1"><p class="MsoFootnoteText"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; vertical-align: super;">[1]</span></a>For someof the neuroanatomical discussion in this chapter, it may again beuseful to refer to appendix E, which contains line drawings of the majorexternal features and landmarks of the human brain.
