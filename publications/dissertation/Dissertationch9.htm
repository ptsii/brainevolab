Answers to these questions will ultimately get uscloser to full understanding of hominid evolution. </p><p class="Indentnormal8">First, it is important to replicate thewithin-family design of the study, preferably with greater samplesizes, with males as well as females, and with subject populations thatdisplay a broader range of ability and/or brain size.  Secondly, itwould be useful, as was pointed out in the last chapter, to tap anumber of cognitive abilities not directly tested in this study,specifically: Better measures of social ability, tests of breadth,depth, and complexity of memory (involving the complexity of semanticrelations, in some form), and tests of serial order memory.  Thirdly,some method of controlling for any within-family effects betweensiblings should be used.  Ideally, identical twin reared in separatehomes would be used.  The correlation between one twin's cognitive testscore and the other's brain anatomy would be a direct estimate of thegenetic correlation between these to variables.  To the extent thatwithin-family effects (such as those caused by sibling rivalry) arerandomized, this would be ideal.  One could check for such effects bylooking for differences between older and younger siblings (relative tothe twins' adoptive siblings), similar to the methods used in thisstudy to suggest some form of sibling interaction.</p><p class="Indentnormal8">Another direction to pursue, which can be donedirectly without any further data collection, is to investigate otherspecific neuroanatomical structures for potential association with thecognitive variables included in this study.  Neuroanatomical variablesfor which it would be possible to quantify with presently availablesoftware tools include: corpus callosum size and shape (which is asubject of current interest in hominid neuroanatomical evolution),frontal lobe cortex volume, cerebellum size (given the grossassociation between cerebellum size and linguistic ability seen inWilliams syndrome patients: Jernigan and Bellugi, 1990), corticalsurface area (including areas such as the frontal lobe), planumtemporale, hippocampus (though this may not be feasible given its smallsize relative to the resolution of the scans), and sub-corticalstructures such as the basal ganglia.</p><p class="Indentnormal8">Also of interest would be to do similarstudies with functional brain imaging: one could investigate the extentto which total area of brain activation on a certain task varied withbrain size, instead of measuring only brain anatomy.  This would get at <i>how</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> the brain might use extra tissue, asopposed to the more basic question of whether more tissue is associatedwith increased behavioral ability.  It appears that increased abilityon a task is associated with </span><i>decreased</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> cortical activation (e.g., Haier </span><i>etal.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1988, Haier </span><i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, 1992). Furthermore, brain glucoseconsumption appears to be inversely related to overall brain size(Yoshii et a. 1988).  This can be reconciled with the idea that amountof neural tissue is important only if the extra neural tissue aids inlearning (and then becomes unnecessary once this is accomplished), or,as discussed above, it results in greater richness and complexity ofcognition or memory.</span></p><p class="Indentnormal8">Another functional imaging study of importancewould be to address the question of what areas of the brain areactivated by processing increasingly complex syntax.  The syntax testinvented for this study, which compares two types of sentencesidentical in every way except their syntax, would lend itselfbeautifully to a functional imaging study.  Brain activation caused bythe two different sentence types could be subtracted from each other todetermine the difference (if any) in functional areas activated by thetwo types of syntax.  This might reveal a great deal about how languageis processed in the brain, and ultimately, how language evolved.</p><p class="Indentnormal8">Finally, it would be valuable to constructmathematical models of brain size cost/benefit tradeoffs, includingbasic empirical cross-species data such as the apparent increase inmetabolic cost, decreased number of offspring per unit time, etc..  Theidea would be to get some idea of the necessary evolutionary value ofthe benefits, and might give us a clearer picture of exactly how strongselection would have to be to accomplish the changes observed over thethree million years of hominid brain size increase.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p></div><p class="MsoFootnoteText"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Copyright 1997 by Paul ThomasSchoenemann</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;<br></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><br></span></p><div class="Section2"><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p></div></body></html>
