name="_Toc494472112">Chapter 5:Rationale of this Study</a></h1><h2><a name="_Toc494464107"></a><a name="5.1">5.1  Limitations ofPrevious Studies</a></h2><p class="Indentnormal4">The evidence reviewed in the previous chaptershows that neuroanatomical variability correlates with behavioraldifferences between species, within other species (specifically rats),as well as within clinical and normal human populations.  This evidenceis consistent with the hypothesis that neuroanatomical variation causesdifferences in behavioral ability. Nevertheless, a number of importantquestions remain to be addressed.</p><p class="Indentnormal4">First, the causality of the correlations hasnot been demonstrated.  In order for the associations betweenneuroanatomical and cognitive dimensions to be evolutionarily relevant,they must be shown to be causally connected.  That is, theneuroanatomical variability must be shown to actually <i>cause</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> differences in cognitive ability, not justbe associated with it.  It is possible for neuroanatomy and cognitiveability to be correlated (through the intermediate influence of othervariables) without one directly causing the other.  The extent to whichthe associations reported in humans are not directly causal is notpresently known.</span></p><p class="Indentnormal4">Second, the studies on human subjects havegenerally limited the range of cognitive tasks that have beeninvestigated, for understandable pragmatic reasons.  For the most partthe emphasis has been on IQ-type tests.  This is reasonable given thenature of IQ.  Cognitive test scores on</p><p class="Indentnormal4" style="text-indent: 0in;">diverse batteries oftests are generally positively correlated, with the number and size ofthe positive correlations among such a battery of tests far exceedingthat expected by chance (Jensen 1987).  This fact forms the theoreticaljustification for the concept of a single ability factor, called <i>g </i><span style="font-style: normal;">, underlying a large portion of thevariability among individuals on a set of cognitive tests (IQ testscores are estimates of </span><i>g</i><span style="font-style: normal;">).Thus, it is understandable that the initial focus of brain size /behavioral ability studies would be on IQ.  Nevertheless, it is quitepossible that other, more specific cognitive dimensions were asimportant, or more so, than </span><i>g </i><span style="font-style: normal;">during human evolution.  Potentiallyimportant cognitive dimensions can be gleaned from an understanding ofthe behavioral changes that occurred during human evolution (as outlinedin chapter 3) and also from a consideration of the neuroanatomicalareas that underwent the greatest change.  Such dimensions include:aspects of linguistic processing (including syntax and access to thesemantic meaning of a given symbol), spatial processing, and dimensionsof prefrontal processing. </span></p><p class="Indentnormal4">It should be noted here that the existence ofa correlation between some cognitive dimension and an evolutionarilyimportant neuroanatomical variable does not constitute evidence thatcognitive dimension was specifically selected for.  It is possible thatit is a side effect of selection on another variable.  Furthermore, ifwe find that cognitive dimension "A" correlates more strongly with,e.g., brain size than dimension "B", this does not constitute evidencethat "A" was selected for more strongly than "B".  It could be that "B"was selected for more strongly, but that the resulting neuroanatomicalchanges inadvertently had greater effects on "A".  Nevertheless, therelative differences in strength of association are not irrelevant toour understanding of human cognitive evolution.  Clearly, if "A"correlates with brain size while "B" does not, it would be hard tomaintain that selection for "B" was the driving force behind brain sizeevolution, and that "A" was irrelevant.</p><p class="Indentnormal4">Third, the neuroanatomical focus has been onoverall brain size.  There are other interesting neuroanatomicalcomponents which might have greater correlations with various cognitivedimensions than overall brain size.  An obvious possibility here isprefrontal cortex, as explained in chapter 4.  Other possibilitiesinclude the cerebrum (which excludes the brain stem), cerebellum, greyvs. white matter, and so forth.</p><p class="Indentnormal4">Fourth, it is not known whether or not thecosts of brain size, which are apparent in cross-species analyses, canbe shown to exist within humans.   If the costs are high within humans(as they are between-species) then we should expect the payoffs to behigh within humans as well.  Conversely, if the costs are low withinhumans, the payoffs will likely be correspondingly low.</p><p class="Indentnormal4">Finally, previous MRI studies obtained brainimages with a spatial resolution no finer than 5 mm<span style="font-size: 9pt; vertical-align: super;">3</span> (because ofindividual slice thickness).  In addition, most scanning routines leftgaps of non-imaged brain tissue between each slice, increasing theeffective resolution to no less than 7 mm<span style="font-size: 9pt; vertical-align: super;">3</span>. </p><p class="Indentnormal4"> </p><h2><a name="_Toc494464108"></a><a name="5.2">5.2  Contribution of thePresent Research</a></h2><h3><a name="_Toc494464109"></a><a name="5.2.1">5.2.1 Within-FamilyCorrelations as a Test of Causality</a></h3><p class="Indentnormal4">If any brain/behavior relationships are to bemeaningful from an evolutionary perspective they must be directlycausally linked: a change in brain anatomy must have some influence onbehavior. The argument that brain size has a direct causal influence onIQ is entirely reasonable given what we know about brain, behavior, andevolution.  However, the demonstration of a correlation between twovariables does not prove that one variable has a direct causal influenceon the other, even though it is an important first step.  A correlationbetween two variables is a necessary consequence of a direct causalrelationship, but because other effects can lead to an associationbetween variables, it cannot constitute proof that one variable iscausing change in the other.</p><p class="Indentnormal4">One way in which a correlation can existbetween two variables without there being a direct causal influence iswhen both are independently influenced by a third variable (or set ofvariables). Such an association will be referred to here as anon-intrinsic correlation (following Jensen 1980).  An example of anon-intrinsic correlation is that between weekly soft-drink sales andthe incidence of polio (before introduction of the Salk vaccine), whichoccurred because polio epidemics were most severe during the summer, notbecause soft-drinks were causing polio (Freedman <i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1978).  With respect to brain/behaviorassociations, it is possible that some environmental influence is actingon both variables independently.  One such influence might be familyincome (or some measure of social class or socio-economic status) whichindependently affects diet, health care, and other variables thataffect the growth of the body, while at the same time influencing thequality of education available to individuals and consequently their IQtest scores as well.  Figure 5.1 illustrates the possible web of causalassociations involving socio-economic status (SES) which could lead toa non-intrinsic association between brain size and cognitive testperformance.  The reciprocal arrows from cognitive test performance toSES serve to illustrate the possibility that test scores might have acausal effect on SES.  This could occur via the long-term economicbenefits of doing well on these sorts of cognitive tests, which couldlead to better nutrition, health care, and other possible correlates ofsomatic growth, thereby leading to larger brain size.  But whatever thetrue direction of these influences, SES could at least theoreticallyexplain the </span></p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times;"><br clear="all" style="page-break-before: always;"></span><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center;"><img width="398" height="249" id="_x0000_i1025" src="Dissertationch5_files/image001.gif"></p><p class="Figurenotes4">&nbsp;</p><p class="Figurenotes4">&nbsp;</p><p class="Figurenotes4">&nbsp;</p><p class="Figurenotes4">&nbsp;</p><p class="Figurenotes4">&nbsp;</p><p class="Figurenotes4">&nbsp;</p><p class="Figurenotes4">&nbsp;</p><p class="Figurenotes4">&nbsp;</p><p class="Figurenotes4">&nbsp;</p><p class="Figurenotes4"> "Figure 5.1 Hypothetical causal links betweenSES, brain anatomy, and behavior" \l 1 Figure 5.1: Hypothetical causalassociations involving socio-economic status which could lead to anon-intrinsic correlation between brain anatomy and cognitiveperformance.

This occurswhenever there is a non-random association between two variables acrossmating pairs: i.e., when variable "A" in one parent is correlated withvariable "B" in the other, and vice-versa.  These variables would thenbe correlated in the offspring (and therefore the population as awhole), but <i>not</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> becausevariable "A" is causing differences in variable "B".  They would becorrelated because the genes influencing variable "A" (derived from oneparent) would be more likely than chance to find themselves in bodiesthat also have genes influencing variable "B" (derived from the otherparent). This could also work if the influences are environmental,instead of (or in addition to) genetic ones.</span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; vertical-align: super;">[1]</span></a> Note herethat conscious knowledge among mating pairs of any cross-correlation ona particular set of traits is not necessary for the association tooccur. Also, it is known that simple assortative mating (in whichvariable "A" is correlated across mating pairs, without regard to othervariables) exists for many traits, both anatomical and (especially)behavioral (the evidence for this will be reviewed below).</p><p class="Indentnormal4">Now it is entirely possible (and in fact quitelikely) that at least some portion of the association between brain sizeand IQ is the result of such non-intrinsic influences: either theinfluence of third variables like SES, or through some form ofcross-assortative mating.  The crucial question, from an evolutionaryperspective, is <i>how much</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> of theassociation is attributable to these non-intrinsic influences? Thatis, a clear understanding of human brain evolution requires that weknow the size of the </span><i>direct</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> causal influence that brain anatomy has onbehavior. For example, note that the relative adaptive benefit ofincreasing brain size over our evolutionary history is proportional toboth: 1) the direct causal association between brain size and behavioralability, and 2) the ratio of costs-to-benefits of increasing brainsize.  If the direct causal influence of brain size on behavior is verysmall, then this will influence our judgment about either the relativeadaptive benefit or the ratio of cost-to-benefits of increasing brainsize.  Thus, the size of the direct causal association between brainsize and behavior is an important piece of the puzzle of human brainevolution.</span></p><p class="Indentnormal4">How, then, can the size of the direct, causalassociation between brain anatomy and behavior be estimated?  There arein principle several ways in which this can be investigated.  Perhapsthe best way is to compare the correlation between brain anatomy andbehavior in pairs of identical twins reared in uncorrelated environments(e.g., adopted into different families).  In this situation, thecross-correlation between one twin's brain anatomy and the other'sbehavior is a direct estimate of the true genetic contribution to thephenotypic resemblance between these variables (Plomin <i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1990). Unfortunately, identical twinsreared in separate homes are very rare, and obtaining access to twinregistries is difficult.  However, there are other geneticallyinformative designs that could be used which vary in their complexityand difficulty. </span></p><p class="Indentnormal4">A reasonable place to begin addressing thisquestion is through a within-family design, in which pairs of siblingsare compared on the traits in question.  Such a design allows one toestimate both between-family and within-family correlations (Jensen1980, 1989, 1990).  Between-family correlations are calculated from meanfamily values on the variables in question.  Within-family correlationsare derived from the signed sibling differences for the variables inquestion (see the next chapter for more detail). Between-familycorrelations include covariance that is due to major (between-family)environmental influences (like SES) as well as that due tocross-assortative mating.  Within-family correlations, on the otherhand, by definition do not contain any covariance due to between-familyinfluences. They also do not contain any covariance due tocross-assortative mating, due to the specifics of meiosis.  Genes amongsiblings within families are a random assortment of their parents genes.Thus, even if there were any cross-assortative mating, thereby leadingto a statistical association among genes for two traits in the overallpopulation, these genes would be randomly assorted with respect to eachother among siblings (and therefore no association between thevariables) within families.</p><p class="Indentnormal4">The statistical independence of between- andwithin-family correlations can be visualized by comparing the two graphsin figure 5.2, which represent hypothetical associations between twovariables for 6 individuals in 3 families (each family pair is connectedby a separate line).  In figure 5.2a, the two variables are correlatedpositively both between-families and within-families.  In figure 5.2b,by contrast, the two variables are correlated positivelybetween-families (i.e., the family means for the two variables areperfectly correlated), but they are <i>negatively</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> correlated within families (the siblingwith a higher value on the x-axis is always lower than the other siblingon the y-axis).  Thus, there is no necessary association between thetwo sets of correlations.</span></p><p class="Indentnormal4">The basic argument is that if differences inbrain anatomy actually cause differences in a particular behavior, thenoffspring who differ from </p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Palatino;"><b><br clear="all" style="page-break-before: always;"></b></span><p class="Figureformatting4" align="center" style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: center; text-indent: -49pt; line-height: normal;"><a name="_Toc494464110">A. <img width="260" height="260" id="_x0000_i1026" src="Dissertationch5_files/image002.gif"></a></p><p class="Figureformatting4" align="center" style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: center; text-indent: -49pt; line-height: normal;"><a name="_Toc494464111">B. <img width="260" height="260" id="_x0000_i1027" src="Dissertationch5_files/image003.gif"></a></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="Figurenotes4">Figure 5.2: The theoretical independence ofbetween versus within family associations.

This is because siblings (unless theyare identical twins) are not born with identical genetic influences.Thus, if they differ neuroanatomically, they must also differbehaviorally if there truly is a genetic association between brain andbehavior. Furthermore, because the within-family correlation is notinflated by between-family environmental effects like SES, or bycross-assortative mating, it is a better estimate of the direct geneticassociation between two variables, and thus is more relevant for anevolutionary understanding of brain/behavior relationships. </span></p><p class="Indentnormal4">There is one caveat, however.  If thewithin-family environmental influences work in opposite ways on the twovariables of interest, and if they are of sufficient magnitude, then thewithin-family correlations between the two variables could be zero evenif the genetic correlation between them is not.  This would require,e.g., that the within-family environmental influences that have theeffect of increasing brain size, must, <i>at the same time</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> have the effect of decreasing IQ (orwhatever cognitive dimension correlates with brain size betweenfamilies). While this may be possible, it is hard to imagine, </span><i>apriori</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, what sorts of influenceswould have such effects. </span></p><p class="Indentnormal4">In any case, the results of a within-familydesign will be a crucial first step in unraveling the genetic andenvironmental influences underlying brain/behavior relationships.  Ifthe correlations are similar both between and within families, thiswould support the hypothesis that these dimensions of brain anatomy andbehavior are influenced by the same genes, and/or that theenvironmentally induced variation in brain anatomy also has behavioraleffects. If the correlations differ significantly, it would call intoquestion the validity of the correlations that have been reportedbetween, e.g., brain size and behavior (as reviewed in chapter 4). Thusimportant knowledge will be gained in either case.</p><p class="Indentnormal4">&nbsp;</p><h4><a name="5.2.1.1">5.2.1.1 Height/IQ and Myopia/IQ Associations:Test Cases</a></h4><p class="Indentnormal4">Examples of this sort of analysis can be foundin studies of the relationship between various dimensions of body sizeand IQ, as well as between myopia and IQ.  Correlations have beendemonstrated between height and IQ test scores (and also between heightand income; see Jensen 1990 for a review).  These associations aretypically smaller than those found in MRI-derived brain/behaviorstudies, though they are still statistically significant. Nevertheless,they raise the general question of why gross biological dimensions likeheight would correlate with behavioral ones at all. Note that this isnot the case with brain size and IQ studies, for which there is atheoretical justification for expecting some sort of an association.</p><p class="Indentnormal4">Interestingly, several studies have shown thatthe correlation between height and IQ is actually zero within families:taller siblings are <i>not</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> morelikely to score higher on IQ tests than shorter siblings (Laycock andCaylor 1964, Hus&#381;n 1959, Jensen 1980, Nagoshi and Johnson 1987).  Thus,as explained above, the association that is found between families (andin the population at large) is not likely due to a direct causalinfluence between height and IQ (either IQ causing differences inheight, or vice versa).  It is not known whether the association betweenheight and IQ is due to an environmental explanation, tocross-assortative mating (the explanation favored by Jensen 1990), orsome combination, but it does suggest that the same question should beasked of brain/behavior associations. </span></p><p class="Indentnormal4">It is also known that myopia is associatedwith higher IQ (see Cohn <i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;">1988 for a review). Empirically, it does not appear that thisassociation is caused by a greater degree of "nearwork" (e.g., reading)in higher IQ subjects. Furthermore, behavior genetic studies point to aclear genetic influence on variance in ocular refraction (Cohn </span><i>etal.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1988).  In contrast to thesituation for height and IQ, the myopia/IQ association is also foundwithin families.    Cohn </span><i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (1988) showed that higher IQ siblings alsotend to have a greater degree of myopia, even though the </span><i>lower</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> IQ siblings tended to spend more timestudying and read more books on average.  A pleiotropic relationship, inwhich genetic influences on IQ also influence the incidence of myopia,would appear to be the most likely explanation in this case.</span></p><p class="Indentnormal4">Thus, within family studies have providedimportant clues to the causal nature of associations between biologicaland behavioral variation.  If brain anatomy has a direct causalinfluence on behavior (i.e., where brain size differences directlyaffect behavioral differences), then either there must exist ademonstrable within-family association, or else we must be able to showthat within-family environmental influences have opposite effects onbrain and behavior.</p><p class="Indentnormal4">&nbsp;</p><h4><a name="5.2.1.2">5.2.1.2 Brain size/IQ Studies of Between- versusWithin-family Correlations</a></h4><p class="Indentnormal4">None of the MRI-based studies of brain sizeand behavior reviewed in chapter 4 have addressed this issue.  However,two studies have addressed it with respect to head-circumference/IQcorrelations. Jensen (1994) analyzed monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ)twins and found that the within-family correlations betweenhead-circumference and <i>g</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> factorscores (an estimate of IQ calculated from the common variance in adiverse set of cognitive tests) was significant for DZ twins (</span><i>r</i><span style="font-style: normal;">= 0.28, </span><i>p</i><span style="font-style: normal;">&lt; 0.05) but not for MZ twins (</span><i>r=</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.01, NS).  This is consistent with thehypothesis of a causal biological association between these variablesbecause the differences between MZ twins within-families are bydefinition entirely due to environmental differences.  However, he foundessentially no correlation between-families for DZ twins (</span><i>r</i><span style="font-style: normal;">= 0.04, NS, though the correlationbetween-families for MZ twins was significant; </span><i>r</i><span style="font-style: normal;">= 0.31, </span><i>p</i><span style="font-style: normal;">&lt; 0.05).  Further troubling was thefinding that the multiple correlation of head length, width, andcircumference with g scores within-families was approximately the samefor both MZ and DZ twins (MZ </span><i>r</i><span style="font-style: normal;">= 0.21, DZ </span><i>r</i><span style="font-style: normal;">= 0.28; both NS), even though thehypothesis predicts that the correlations should be significantlydifferent. In a different analysis of a large body of data from theNational Collaborative Perinatal Project (total </span><i>N</i><span style="font-style: normal;">= 28,992), Jensen and Johnson (1994) foundthat the within-family correlations between head circumference and IQ in7 year olds were almost half as large (57%) as the correspondingbetween-family correlations (mean within-family </span><i>r</i><span style="font-style: normal;">= 0.12, </span><i>p</i><span style="font-style: normal;">&lt;0.05; mean between-family </span><i>r</i><span style="font-style: normal;">= 0.21, </span><i>p</i><span style="font-style: normal;">&lt; 0.001).</span></p><p class="Indentnormal4">These two studies suggest that a significantportion of the correlation between head circumference and IQ is notattributable to direct causal connections between the two variables.Given that MRI-based studies consistently report larger correlations toIQ than do head circumference studies, I sought to investigate the samequestion of between-family vs. within-family correlations usingMRI-derived brain size estimates.  Since the within-family correlationis potentially the most meaningful from the standpoint of explainingbrain size evolution, it is crucial that this be estimated as accuratelyas possible.  Thus, the present study uses a within-family design, andwithin-family associations were estimated for all brain/behaviorassociations that were found.</p><p class="Indentnormal4">&nbsp;</p><h3><a name="_Toc494464112"></a><a name="5.2.2">5.2.2 Expanding theVariety of Cognitive Dimensions Addressed</a></h3><p class="Indentnormal4">A wide variety of cognitive domains wereaddressed in the present research.  Psychological studies of individualdifferences (psychometrics) has delimited four major cognitive factors(in addition to many lesser ones; Jensen 1987).  These factors are namedaccording to the types of tests that load (correlate) most highly witheach factor.  The verbal factor is so described because the tests whichload most highly on it all share some explicit linguistic component. Examples include vocabulary, reading comprehension, and related tests. The spatial factor is defined by tests which lack obvious linguisticcomponents, but instead deal with the location, interrelation, and/ormovement of objects in space.  Examples are tests of howthree-dimensional objects might look if rotated into different views("mental rotation" tests).  As noted in chapter 3, spatial ability isnot as cleanly described by single tests, unlike the verbal factor(Lohman 1988).  A third factor involves explicit tests of short-termmemory.  Finally, there is a general factor, designated <i>g</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> , which cuts across these categories. </span></p><p class="Indentnormal4">As noted above, cognitive tests almost withoutexception correlate positively with each other, even if they differsubstantially in the sorts of abilities they require (Jensen 1987). Forexample, the vocabulary and block design (spatial) portions of thewidely used Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) correlated onaverage <i>r=</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.52 across all agegroups in their standardization sample (</span><i>N</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> = 1880), even though these two testsappear to require completely different abilities (block design has noobvious verbal component, and vocabulary has no spatial component;Wechsler 1981). </span><i>G</i><span style="font-style: normal;">typically explains more than 40 percent of the total variance in variedsets of cognitive tests, while the other factors combined account foronly about 15 percent (the remainder being variance specific toindividual tests; Jensen 1987).  It is important to note, however, thatthese test batteries typically do not contain tests known to be specificto prefrontal functioning, which generally correlate very little with </span><i>g</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> -loaded tests.</span></p><p class="Indentnormal4">There are practical limitations for any givenstudy in the number of cognitive dimensions that can be investigated.At the same time, since an important contribution of the present studyis to broaden the range of behavioral features investigated, it isimportant to include tests of the four basic factors (outlined above),so that the variance in any new tests (which might be shared with thesebasic dimensions) can be controlled for.  If, for example, we find thatsome new test of interest is correlated with brain size, we cannot besure that this correlation is due to some unique aspect of the demandsof this new test unless we first determine the extent to which itcorrelates with <i>g</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> or one of theother major cognitive factors.  Only if we find that the correlationwith this new test is not due to its correlation with these other moregeneral factors can we be confident that we have discovered a uniquecorrelate of brain size (and/or any other neuroanatomical dimension ofinterest). For this reason, the following tests were included as markersfor the basic factors (detailed descriptions of the tests appear in theMethods chapter).  As an estimate of </span><i>g</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, a adaptation of Raven's ProgressiveMatrices was used (This is widely acknowledged to be an excellentmeasure of </span><i>g</i><span style="font-style: normal;">; Jensen1987). A standard vocabulary test, included in the MultidimensionalAptitude Battery (Jackson 1984) was used as a marker for the verbalcomponent. A computerized adaptation of the Vandenberg and Kuse (1978)Mental Rotation Test, in a reaction-time format, was used to gaugespatial abilities.  No test of short-term memory was included, becauseit was deemed less likely than other dimensions (see below) to havecontributed significantly to brain size (this was a pragmatic decision;it is possible that this was a tactical mistake that will need to beaddressed in future studies).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24pt;">&nbsp;</p><h4><a name="5.2.2.1">5.2.2.1 Prefrontal tests</a></h4><p class="Indentnormal4">In addition to the basic dimensions, teststhat have shown some sort of specificity to prefrontal cortex wereincluded for the first time in any study to date.  As has been discussedin previous chapters, the prefrontal cortex has undergone much greaterchange than any other region during our evolutionary history. Unfortunately, because of the types of behavioral deficits evidenced byindividuals with prefrontal damage, it has proven difficult to createreliable and valid tests of prefrontal function that are both easy toadminister and (most importantly) show some sort of gradation ofability across normal subjects.  It is known that subjects withprefrontal damage often score normally on standard IQ tests whileshowing gross problems on everyday tasks involving some component ofplanning (Shallice and Burgess 1991).  As a starting point, it wasdecided to include four tests which generally show prefrontalspecificity (e.g., in brain damaged patients) while at the same timedemonstrating significant individual variation in normal subjects(Shallice and Burgess 1991, Daigneault <i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1992, Lezak 1983).  The four testsselected included: The Trails test (Reitan and Wolfson 1985), theWisconsin Card Sort Test (WCST, Heaton 1981), the Verbal Fluency test(Thurstone and Thurstone 1941), and the Stroop test (Stroop 1935; Golden1978). </span></p><p class="Indentnormal4">The trails test is essentially aconnect-the-dots task with two parts.  The first (part A) involves onlynumbers, arranged such that the subject can obtain information on wherethey will have to go after the immediate goal is reached.  For example,the number 14 is located very close to the path between 12 and 13, suchthat the subject can potentially plan on the way to 13 which directionthey will have to go next.   The second portion of the Trails Test (partB) involves alternating between numbers and letters of the alphabet,such that the subject must connect the dots in the following pattern: 1-&gt; A -&gt; 2 -&gt; B -&gt; 3 -&gt; C ... etc..  These are alsoarranged in the same manner as in part A, such that the subject canplan ahead. </p><p class="Indentnormal4">The WCST is a test which requires the subjectto sort a long series of cards according to certain criteria which keepchanging. The cards are designed such that there are three basic,independent ways the cards could be sorted: either by shape of theobjects on the card, by number of objects, or by the kind of patternfilling the objects.  The subject must first figure out which of thesepotential sorting criteria is actually being rewarded, simply on thebasis of being told their choice (which is initially a guess) is"correct" or "incorrect".  After the subject demonstrates they havefigured out which criteria is currently being rewarded, the correctcriteria is changed and the subject must figure out (on the basis ofsimple "correct" or "incorrect" feedback responses) what the new sortingcriterion is.  This test is not so much a test of planning, but rathera test of how flexible the subject is to changing criteria.</p><p class="Indentnormal4">The Verbal Fluency task requires the subjectto list as many words as possible that start with a particular letter ofthe alphabet. Three different letters are used (to minimize the impactof "blanking out" on any one letter), and a one minute time limit isused for each letter.  Since words are not stored in our mental lexiconalphabetically, this is as much a test of the ability to suppressobvious associations as it is a test of vocabulary size.   For example,the word "chair" for most people brings to mind the word "table" or"sitting," both of which are incorrect responses and must be quicklysuppressed to obtain the best scores.</p><p class="Indentnormal4">Lastly, the Stroop test presents the subjectwith conflicting cues: linguistic and visual (color), and requires thatthe subject pay attention only to the color cue.  For example, the word"red" is written in blue ink, and the subject must respond "blue". Thisis very difficult for most subjects (including normal ones).  It wouldappear to be essentially a test of the ability to suppress obviouslinguistic cues. There are control tasks which allow for differences insimple reading and color identifying ability (the reading ability taskcould also potentially be used to assess phonological production speed).</p><p class="Indentnormal4">From these descriptions, it is clear that noneof these tests can be considered a pure test of prefrontal function. Itis essential to include a basic battery tapping verbal, spatial, andgeneral (<i>g</i><span style="font-style: normal;">) cognitiveabilities, such that these other dimensions may be factored out of theprefrontal tests.  As a basic example, Daigneault </span><i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> (1992) conclude that there are (weak)prefrontal factors which can be extracted from a set of prefrontaltests. However, since their test battery does not include markers for </span><i>g</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, verbal, spatial, or memory, it is quitepossible that these factors are not specific to prefrontal functioningat all, but instead are a further manifestation of these other generalcognitive domains. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24pt;">&nbsp;</p><h4><a name="5.2.2.2">5.2.2.2 Additional linguistic tests</a></h4><p class="Indentnormal4">In addition to a basic vocabulary test,several other dimensions of linguistic processing were investigated.Three dimensions were of particular interest: phonological processing,semantic retrieval and syntax processing.  Phonological processing isnot essential to language, as is evidenced by the existence of varioussign languages, but semantic retrieval and syntax clearly are essential.With respect to syntax, however, linguists in the generative grammarschool expressly deny that there are meaningful individual differencesin syntax and grammatical ability among individuals.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; vertical-align: super;">[2]</span></a>Similarly, the evolutionary psychologists Tooby and Cosmides (1990) holdthat basic adaptations of a species (including cognitive adaptations)will be essentially invariable.  They argue that the network ofinterlocking parts that make up a whole organism is so complex thatanything more than minor tinkering would cause problems when differentparts are reshuffled during genetic recombination.  However, there musthave been meaningful individual variation at each point along thecontinuum of populations leading from the language-less ancestors to thelanguage-using descendent populations.  It is exactly this variationwhich we are concerned about in this study.</p><p class="Indentnormal4">There are a large number of cognitive testswhich tap different linguistic processes.  Phonological processing speedwas gauged by a portion of the stroop test discussed above.  The firstpart of this test requires the subject to simply read a random orderingof three color words: red, green and blue (this is used a control taskfor the stroop condition in which the color and word do not match; seemethod section below). Unfortunately, there were no existing testswhich allowed such components as syntax and semantic retrieval to bestudied in isolation from other components.  For this reason, two taskswere invented for this study specifically to address these twolinguistic processes. </p><p class="Indentnormal4">Semantic retrieval was studied through areaction-time task which required the subject to correctly match up aword to a picture (which might or might not correspond).  The time ittook to respond correctly is a measure of how fast the individual could1) decode the meaning of the word, 2) process the picture, 3) comparethe results, and 4) respond.  In order to control for differences invocabulary size, only a few simple words were used which every Englishspeaker could be expected to have highly over-learned: circle, square,triangle, and star (see the next chapter for details).  Because of theneed to limit the testing time (out of concern for test fatigue on thepart of the subjects) as well as the desire to give as broad a set ofcognitive tasks as possible, only these four words were used.  In orderto control for individual differences in the ability to simply respondquickly, irrespective of the task, a simple reaction time task was alsogiven (on the same computer apparatus).  It is important to recognizethat no single task will be perfect, but that this test would certainlygive some indication of individual differences in semantic retrieval.</p><p class="Indentnormal4">Syntax processing was tested by takingadvantage of the fact that not all syntactic structures are as easy toprocess as others, even for fluent speakers.  A well known exampleoccurs when relative clauses are embedded within other clauses (Yngve1960, Miller and Chomsky 1963, Foss and Lynch 1969, Bever 1970, Kuno1974, Cook 1975, Abe <i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;">1988). For example, compare the two following sentences:</span></p><p class="Indentnormal4">1) The man kissed the woman who ran. </p><p class="Indentnormal4">2) The woman whom the man kissed, ran.</p><p class="notindentednormal4">In sentence 2, the clause "...whom theman kissed..." is embedded in the center of the clause "Thewoman...ran". This type of syntax can be referred to as"center-embedded". In sentence 1, the clause "...who ran" is added tothe right of the clause "The man kissed the woman," and can therefore bereferred to as "right-branching".  Center-embedded sentences arenormally harder to process than right-branching ones.  Furthermore, itturns out that there are individual differences in how difficultcenter-embedded sentences are to process (Cook 1975).  This fact wasused as the basis for a test for which it is possible to extract ameasure of syntax processing that is independent of all other aspects oflinguistic processing. </p><p class="Indentnormal4">The basic format of the test followed thatused in the seminal studies on sentence verification by Clark and Chase(1972), in which the subject was presented with simple sentences whichmight or might not correspond to pictures presented at the same time.Their data showed that the time required to verify that the sentence andpicture corresponded was related in a regular way to the linguisticcomplexity of the sentence (see also Carpenter and Just 1975). However,in these studies the semantic aspects of the sentence are intertwinedwith the syntactic aspects, such that the differences due solely tosyntax can not be disentangled.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; vertical-align: super;">[3]</span></a> In thepresent study, this was controlled for by comparing reaction times forpairs of sentences which differ in clause structure (center-embeddedversus right branching), but are identical in the semantic units used.For example, compare sentences 3 and 4 below:</p><p class="Indentnormal4">3) The square is beside the circle which isabove the star.</p><p class="Indentnormal4">4) The square which the circle is beside isabove the star.</p><p class="Indentnormal4">These two sentences have exactly the samenumber of words, and the words used are exactly the same.  The onlydifference between these sentences is in their syntactic structure.Thus, differences in mean reaction time between sets of sentences likethese cannot be due to semantic differences. </p><p class="Indentnormal4">Unfortunately, it is possible that thedifferences between individuals on how much these syntactic structuresinfluence sentence verification times are due to differences in therichness of their past linguistic experience.  If some individuals aremore likely to have heard center-embedded sentences before than others,this past experience might result in smaller differences in verificationtimes for these individuals because of this.  While the experimentaldesign used here cannot exclude this possibility, at least twocorrelates should appear in the pattern of results.  First, individualswho have a greater depth of linguistic experience will likely do betteron both sentence types.  That is, we might expect a correlation between1) mean reaction time for both sentence types and 2) the differencebetween center-embedded and right-branching sentences.  Secondly, weshould expect the difference between the sentence types to correlatewith the degree of educational background or socio-economic status. Both of these correlates can be checked on the present data (see below).</p><p class="Indentnormal4">Again, no test is perfect, but these testsspecifically address the basic linguistic dimensions of syntax andsemantic retrieval.</p><p class="notindentednormal4">&nbsp;</p><h4><a name="5.2.2.3"></a>5.2.2.3 Throwing accuracy</h4><p class="Indentnormal4">Throwing accuracy has not been measured in anyMRI study to date.  In this study it was measured in a dart throwingtask in which the subject was given 12 throws to get as close aspossible to a central spot located on a cork board 275 cm away.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24pt;">&nbsp;</p><h4><a name="5.2.2.4">5.2.2.4 Social Dimensions</a> </h4><p class="Indentnormal4">There are a few pencil and paper tests thatinvestigate social intelligence (e.g., Marlowe 1986), but it seemed thatthe most direct way to investigate social ability would be to askquestions relating specifically to the number of social contacts of eachsubject.  As discussed in chapter 3, there is extensive evidence thatrelative neocortex size is highly correlated across primate specieswith the size of the social group.  Thus, the most direct comparisonwithin humans would be some measure of the number of social contactsreported by each individual subject.  The subjects were asked to count(in front of the experimenter) the number of individuals listed intheir address books (and to subtotal the number that were relatives). They were asked to estimate the number of individuals they talked tofor more than five minutes in the prior week, as well as the number ofindividuals they spent time with socially in the average month. Lastly, they were asked to rate themselves as to how social theyconsidered themselves, and to compare their own degree of sociality tothat of their participating sibling (pairs of siblings were tested -see below).  Again, none of these can be considered perfect measures ofsocial ability or social intelligence. Nevertheless, it represents acrucial initial step in addressing this fundamental question.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24pt;">&nbsp;</p><h3><a name="_Toc494464113"></a><a name="5.2.3">5.2.3  Expanding theNeuroanatomical Subdivisions Addressed</a></h3><p class="Indentnormal4">There are a number of neuroanatomicalsubdivisions which are of interest in addition to overall brain size.The cerebral cortex is the site of conscious awareness, processing ofprimary sensory information, cross-modal associations, spatialprocessing, language (in humans), planning, and other complex mentalfunctions. The lower brain stem, including the medulla, is involved inbasic autonomic functions, such as breathing, heart rate, etc..  Thecerebellum appears to be primarily involved in (sub-consciously)fine-tuning muscle control and tone, although there are some indicationsthat it may also contribute to higher cortical functions such aslanguage (Leiner <i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1986).Within each of these major divisions, neural tissue can be classifiedinto two types: grey and white.  Neuronal cell bodies are found in greymatter, while axons (which carry signals across relatively largedistances) are found primarily in white matter.  As a roughapproximation, white matter can be thought of as connective wiringbetween processing units (which are areas in the cerebral cortex andsub-cortical nuclei), while the grey matter represents the processingunits themselves.  The axons in white matter are insulated with layersof myelin - a fatty substance which appears white on visual inspection.The white and grey regions can be quite distinct on MRI scans, giventhe correct scanning parameters, which allows accurate quantificationof these two variables.</span></p><p class="Indentnormal4">&nbsp;</p><h3><a name="_Toc494464114"></a><a name="5.2.4">5.2.4  What is theEffect of Increasing Brain Size on Maturation-Rate?</a></h3><p class="Indentnormal4">As was pointed out in chapter 3, one of themost obvious evolutionary costs to large brain mass appears to be thatit takes an increasingly long time for larger brains to mature.  Thecorrelation between age at first breeding in females and overall adultbrain size is <i>r=</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 0.96 across abroad sample of 47 primates (Harvey and Clutton-Brock 1985).  The longerit takes offspring to mature, the fewer offspring an individual canproduce per unit time.  Thus, assuming the correlation is causal,individuals with smaller brains should have an evolutionary advantageover those with larger brains, all else being equal.</span></p><p class="Indentnormal4">The extent to which brain size correlates withrate of maturation within any species has apparently not been addressedto date.  By recruiting women, it is possible to estimate rate ofmaturation by asking the subjects to recall the age at which they hadtheir first menstrual period. Recalled age at menarche has been shown tobe a reliable and valid measure, even over long periods of time (Geary1989, Damon and Bajema 1974, Bean <i>et al.</i><span style="font-style: normal;"> 1979).  However, the extent to whichvariation in age at menarche can be ascribed to genetic differences doesnot appear to be large.  Johnston (1974) reviews evidence suggestingthat at least 10 to 15 percent of the variation in age at menarche isgenetically influenced.  Tanner (1962, cited in Johnston 1974) showedthat monozygotic twins differed by only two to three months in age atmenarche, compared to 12 months difference on average for dizygotic(fraternal) twins.  Socio-economic status does not appear to have asignificant effect across the board, though the number of sibs in afamily does (independent of socio-economic status; Johnston 1974). </span></p><p class="Indentnormal4">Since the present study will also be comparingsibling differences, major between-family environmental effects (such associo-economic status, number of siblings, etc.) will be controlledfor, with the hope that intrinsic genetic influences will therefore beemphasized. This is probably the best we can do within humans.Obviously a large sample size would be nice, but not practical given thecost of acquiring MRI scans on each subject.  Thus, this question isnot the focus of the present study.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24pt;">&nbsp;</p><h3><a name="_Toc494464115"></a><a name="5.2.5">5.2.5  AdditionalVariables of Interest</a></h3><p class="Indentnormal4">Because correlations could occur betweenneuroanatomical and cognitive dimensions for reasons other than directcausation (e.g., through the influence of a third variable, as pointedout above), the possible effect of the most obvious such candidate,socio-economic status (SES), will be addressed as well.  Four pieces ofdata will be used to estimate this parameter: 1) mother's years inschool, 2) father's years in school, 3) socio-economic status rating ofparents job (using a standard SES index; see methods section), and 4) aquestionnaire, known as the Home Index of status items, which asks aboutitems and aspects of the subject's home environment which arecorrelated with SES (Gough 1971). </p><p class="Indentnormal4">&nbsp;</p><h3><a name="_Toc494464116"></a><a name="5.2.6">5.2.6  Increasing MRISpatial Resolution</a> </h3><p class="Indentnormal4">Technical advances are occuring constantly inMRI technology, such that it is now possible to acquire brain image datawith a spatial resolution of 1.3 mm<span style="font-size: 9pt; vertical-align: super;">3</span> (0.9375 mm X0.9375 mm X 1.5 mm), with no gaps, covering the entire brain, andproviding excellent grey/white tissue differentiation.
